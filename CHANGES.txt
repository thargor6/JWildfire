V2.00 (xx.xx.2014):
 - reworked the whole HDR-export again, background-color is supported now
 - 30 new imnages for the launcher
 - the OpenCl-option is now hidden per default (double-click to image to get it back)
 
 - general note #1: if you have any strange behaviour in the user-interface, please switch back to "Nimbus"-theme, this is the only one which is supported. All others may (should) work, but may not, they are using an external library
 - general note #2: The HDR-export has slöightly improved again. But it is impossible to satisfy anyone with it, because everybody uses other tools to process those kind of files. The current way of producing them should work for the most people. 
 
 - one more fix to the HDR-export
 - slightly faster cancel of rendering in interactive renderer/detached preview
 - macro-bar is horizontal now per default, but this can be changed in the Prefs
 - renamed the "GAMMA"-colorcurve-type into "BRIGHTNESS"
 - new property "Fade to White" at the color-tab
 - two new columns showing the variations/caption in the xaos-view
 - new "reset"-button to reset gradient to their original state (usual faster to use than undo, which also would work, of course)
  
 
 - created a small detached preview is showing the currently edited flame in constantly increasing quality
 - the fading-slider of the realtime-preview now got a hint and actually can fade the preview to black (thanks to Martin Flink)
 - added more clear indicators to show if a motion curve is present or not  

 - you can now create your own buttons to execute your own scripts in the editor! I. E., you have in the script-tab the possibility to add a persistent 
   button to the user-interface to execute a certain script. You may, of course, cutomize it. Just select script and hit the "Add macro button"-button to add a new button to the user-interace which executes this script. You can have as many buttons as you want! 
 - addded 5 default macro-buttons (which also may be customized or removed)
 - display the layer number in layer-preview
 - added support for animating the shift-paremeter of gradients by using motion-curves
 - added support for animating weight, color, color-speed and opacity of transforms by using motion-curves
 - new option to draw guides (center point, rule of thirds and the golden ratio) as known from Apo in the editor. You may control the colors and line-widths by changing the properties tinaEditorGuidesCenterPointColor, tinaEditorGuidesRuleOfThirdsColor, tinaEditorGuidesGoldenRatioColor and tinaEditorGuidesLineWidth in the Preferences-window
 - the "Xaos"-tab now features the "from"- and "to"-views as known from Apo
 - several "Reset-to-defaults"-button at several tabs
 - changed the HDR-exporter in the way that it also executes the log-scaling-step which solves some problems and seems to ease to processing of those kind of images by certain other software-packages
 - fixed a bug in the renderer causing a bright spot at (0,0) sometimes
 - fixed a bug regarding the update of the frame slider in the main editor. Fixed a bug regarding the length of the gradient-guide on the transformation-color-tab

 - new "ennepers2"-variation by dark-beam
 - the optional grid and display of affine transfomsm ishould be correct aligned to the center noew
 - added a new method tho the scripting-interface which creates a new random flame when there is currently no flame in the editor. This simplifies the script-initializing code
 
 - button for simply-generation of bokeh-like effects in the main editor - it's pure fun!
 - new "Rect"-bokeh-style
 - ability to use/create motion-curves made from mp3-audio, it has never been easier to create a sound-sync motion of a flame-fractal!
 - ability to transform (shift, scale) motion-curves in the motion-curve-dialog
 - improved the behaviour of "view-all"-function in the motion-curve-dialog
 - increased the preview quality in the motion-curve-dialog (may be slower, but makes sense to see more detail here)
 - options to specify custom (individual) sizes or quality-levels in the batch-renderer
 - option to override (re-render) images in the Batch-renderer
 - ability to display also rendered images in the batch-renderer

 - some experimental OpenCl-code which can cause faster rendering on some devices (use the new checkbox in the launcher to turn it on or off, per default it is off) 
 - experimental channel mixer which allows to adjust raw fractal colors using several modes:
    - gamma
    - rgb (one curve for each color component)
    - full (three curves for each color component)
 - new "NBlur"-bokeh style
 - optimized the refresh of the display of the interactive renderer (disable property tinaOptimizedRenderingIR in the Prefs if this makes problems on slow machines) 
 - several small optimizations to the renderer
 - the launcher now shows an error message (different from the technical java-error) when it detects a 32bit java and a memory usage below 1 GB 

 - retain selected layer after "Undo"/"Redo"
 - smoother transition between DoF and non-DoF-areas
 - new "Stripes"-random-gradient-generator
 - renamed the misspelled "Responsibility"-property into "Responsiveness"
 - fine-tuned the new "responsiveness"-setting

 - new "Black&White"-random-flame-generator inspired by the "B&W converter"-script by Brad Stefanov and Mick Hogan
 - changed the "*crop", "*circlecrop" and "fract*"-variations to use the new mechanism to hide samples (should remove an "annoying vertical line" in some cases)
 - support for actually hiding pixels which can be used from within variations to control visibility, especiall useful for cropping which really crops instead of setting points at a random position or zero
 - added a new experimental option to make the program (and the OS) more responsible while rendering. This is enabled by default. Change the property "tinaResponsibility" in the Prefs-window to tune the behaviour
 - internally reworked the strategy of the refresh of the display of the interactive renderer
 - added new scripts "Add Random Final FX by MH and MO", "Textured_Cylinders_Rev01_by_MH" and "Crackle_Styles_Chooser_Rev01_by_MH", all created  by Mick Hogan, as Standard-Scripts
 - added new scripts "LoonieSplits DT", "Buckballs by DT" and "M&M Flower DT", all created  by Don Town as Standard-Scripts
 - experimental support for an additional alpha channel which can be modified by variations
 - new "dinis_surface"-variation
 - new "pre_rect"-variation

 - created a fix to avoid the default "overexposing" of many flames, i.e. most renders should look darker by default, but should look more smooth
 - created a new "Bokeh"-subtab on the "DOF"-tab. Here you can adjust different options to create awesome "bokeh"-like effects
 - tried to make the Interactive Renderer behave more "smooth"
 - added two new parameters to "fract_*"-variations: "z_fill" to fill the vertical gaps in 3d-mode, "z_logscale" to use log-scale in z-direction (nice for creating 3D-meshes)
 - fixed an unwanted "dot" in the "primitives_wf"-variation, when drawing a pyramid-shape
 - new experimental "xheart_blur"-variation (which bases on "xheart" by Xyrus02)
 - fixed dark background in the help-section

V1.90 (24.08.2014):
 - Motion-Curves in the Main-Editor:
    - after a long period of development I finally decided to enable the motion-curve-editor in the main editor! This means you can define 
      a motion curve (drawn with you mouse) for each flame-property to create awesome animations, using the most easy-to-use interface possible. 
      You may even add controlled motion-blur! 
      Or you can use this feature to modify different properties at the same time to find "interesting spots". The possibilities are endless :-)
      You will see a new large button to enable/disable this new features. I. E. if you dont care about animations, you will notice no change,
      unless you press this button :-)    
      A video-tutorial on all this stuff will come later...
    - preview-playback-function for the global motioncurve-editing-mode
    - automatically save the flame rendered in the interactive renderer as "jwf_ir_current.flame" (like an auto quicksave). So, in case of a rare crash you will always keep you latest flame in the IR.
      
 - Mesh-Generator:
    - new Option to skip slices in the mesh-generating-process  
    - added some image-pre-filtering-options to modify (smooth) the generated slices 
    - some experimental option to thicken details, may get obsolete by using the pre-filters (requires more testing, any feedback is welcome)
    - Created an official JWildfire-shop at shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/jwildfire (It is not about making money, just to show what 
      the mesh-generator can do. But you can also buy this stuff, of course, I have tried to make the prices as fair as possible)  
    
 - Other changes:
    - improved the speed and "smoothness" of the interactive renderer
    - extended the "mandelbrot"-variation by three params: "seed" (allowing fixed random shapes which may be better animated), "max_points" (to specify the number of fixed major points which build the shape, good if you plan to increase the surface by using a blur-variation) and "rnd_z_range" (specify a range at the z-direction where the major points get distributed, can lead to much more interesting models)
    - added new shape TRIANGLE and PYRAMID to "primitives_wf"-variation (right, it is now easy to build the pyramids :D)
    - fixed the encoding of the start_mac.command file, thanks again to Matthew Townsend
    - new "sph3D"-variation by Xyrus02
    - added the methode getCurrLayer() to the script-runner-interface
    - some additions to the FAQ-section    
    
V1.80 (10.08.2014):
 - new module to generate meshes from 3d-flame-fractals! The module consists of three parts: 
     - a volumetric renderer
     - a mesh generator which uses the marching-cubes-algorithm to generate a mesh from a stack of rendered images
     - a previewer which can either create a quick-preview by some internal renderer or a high quality-preview by using the integrated sunflow-renderer 
   In comparison to some other solutions the module has the following strengths: 
     - it works multi-threaded and has decent speed
     - it creates not only vertices, but also vertex normals
     - it is able to process really huge meshes, if you have enough memory
     - the mesh-generator supports additional smoothing and can process any image-stack in the formats supported by JWildfire. So probably you could also convert Mandelbulb3D Voxelstack by using this modeule (I have not tried it, so any feedback is welcome) 
     - it is extensible and open source   
 - restructured the Help/About-section, updated some informations, added an Aphophysis-users-hints-page
 - improved the "Strong hue"-random-color-generator to produce more interesting results
 - black-border-fix for the "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "log_db"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "asteria"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "ztwister"-variation by dark-beam
 - made the "custom_wf"-variations more robust to errors. If an error occurs during regular calculation (e.g. after loading a flame with errors in the java-code) the variation does nothing. If you edit the code, you cant save it until you fixed the error
 - improved start-script for Macs by Matthew Townsend
 - new fluent-API to create sunflow-scenes (only interesting for developers)

V1.70 (06.07.2014):
 - new tab for local modification of gamma, contrast and saturation on a transform-basis. 
   Those work similiar to the color values ("color" and "color-speed"), but they control changes in applied color values, 
   rather than specifying color values themselfs. This is a true new addition to the Flame Fractal Algorithm itself, 
   and makes it much more easy to create flame fractals with more depth, without the need of endless fiddling with the gradient :-)     
 - new buttoms for randomization and reset of local color effects   
 - new mutation-type "Local gamma" allowing local-gamma-modifications in the MutaGen-module

 - improved "cross"-random-flame-generator, also uses the new "rays"-variations 
 - made the "custom_wf"-variation more robust against compile/syntax errors
 
V1.64 (20.06.2014):
 - improved the precision of the the numberic fields (7 digits after the decimal point are guaranteed in the most cases), which is especially great for gnarls. Thanks for dark-beam for pointing at this old bug! :-)
 - improved the smoothness of modifying parameters by dragging the mouse by about factor 2.5
 - the "Fine"-adjustment is now also taken into account when modifying parameters by dragging the mouse. If the "Fine"-button is enabled all changes have a increased smoothness (precision) by factor 10.      
 - new experimental and super-cool "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "loonie2" and "loonie3"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "Rays"-random-flame-generator which uses some of the new featurs to create really cool random flames

 - introducing a new concept of random-gradient-generators (orthogonal to random-flame- and random-symmetry-generators)
 - new "Strong hue"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Smooth"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Monochrome"-random-gradient-generator

 - new "saturation"-setting under "Coloring" (which affects the saturation of the final image. A saturation of 1.0 is the default value. Lower values decrease saturation, i. E. the fractals appears more "gray", higher values add more levels of "color" )

 - new "color map"-random-flame-generator, using randomly chosen images from your image-collection as color-map (you must specify the base-path in the prefs, but please BEWARE that this path is scanned recursively, so please check if you have any "forbidden" images there). This generator is NOT included in the "All"-random-flame-generator, so it must be selected explicitely

 - new "Move to"/"Copy to"-functions in the flame browser
 - some additional "post_*"-scripts for the Easy Movie Maker

 - controls in the editor have now a shadow the increase the contrast with the background (can be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorControlsWithShadows)
 - controls in the editor may now we drawn in much more nice way with antialising (can be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorControlsWithAntialiasing)
 - ability to draw a grid in the editor, the grid size is fixed to 0.5, but may be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorGridSize
 - transforms in the editor may now be dran with the transform-number displayed, this can be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorControlsWithNumbers

 - simplified the LogDensityFilter (only internal changes)
 - removed the upper-range-limitation of the "gamma threshold"-parameter

V1.50 (30.03.2014):
 - there were really lots of changes in the Easy Movie Maker:
     - new concept of random-movie-generators (which create both random flames and random motion)
     - new random-movie-generators:
         - "Rotating Mandelbrots"
         - "Transforming Duckies"
         - "Transforming Bubbles"
     - motion blur, which is enabled by default and can even be used to render interesting/"dynamic" still images    
     - new concept of "morph-types", the old behaviour is now called MORPH, and there is now a new morph type called FADE which uses layerz to fade one flame into another

     - some new simple scripts
     - render button for instantly creating a preview-render in high quality

     - movie ribbon with movie-preview, allows to switch between different movies at any time (same concept as for flames in the amin editor)
     - realtime-preview of animation-scripts in the Easy Movie Maker (you may even change scripts while showing the preview)
     - dramatically increased the speed of evaluating motion curves
     - motions in the Easy Movie Maker now respect the FPS setting (rather than calculating the speed by the total number of frames)
     - removed *_NEG animation-scripts, refactoring of the Easy Movie Maker
 - additional camera-controls (x-, y- and z-position), this makes it possible to create really "different" images!  
 - new "dc_hexes_wf" variation, which is derived from the well-known "hexes"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information 
 - new "dc_crackle_wf variation, which is derived from the well-known "crackle"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information   
 - new SIDE_BY_SIDE_FULL-preview-mode for stereo3d images (uses larger preview area)
 - new option to easily swap sides in stereo3d-rendering

 - caption of layerz is now stored/restored correctly
 - bugfix in the checks variation, can actually produce nice patterns now
 - fixed a problem regarding the re-saving of movies from older version
 - stepped back to Java 6 because of problems with Java 7 on the Mac platform 
 
V1.40 (15.03.2014):
 - comprehensive support for stereo3d-rendering with many options and major improvements/refactoring of the rendering-engine "under the hood" 
 - the software comes now with an IzPack-based (http://izpack.org/) installer which should work on all platforms 
 - as Java version 8 will come out soon, the minimum requirements of JWildfire were increased to Java 7, i.e. it is optimized for Java 7 or higher
 - changed the camera handling: in 3d-flames there is now a real 3d camera, in 2d flames there is a 2d-camera. (In previous releases there was a "mixed" mode of 2D camera roll and 3D pith and yaw, as introduced by the famous "3d hack" invented by Zueuk)
 - added post-symmetry-support for the script-from-flame-generator
 - made the "layer-append-mode"-indicator smaller and aligned it to the bottom-right-corner
 - renamed the "JWFMovie Maker" into "Easy Movie Maker"
 - new output type FLAMES in Easy movie maker (for just generating flames)

 - removed the JWildfireC sub project (will be replaced by some OpenCL-based stuff later)

V1.30 (02.03.2014):
 - New concept of "post-symmetries". A post symmetry is something like a "final transform after a final transform". 
 But unlike to a ordinary final transform it can clone samples and modify those clones, making it very efficient to create fractals with certain symmetry.
 For example, for a mirror-like-symmetry it creates for any input sample one mirrored clone.        
 You also could achieve this by designing the fractal, but using the post-symmetries makes it much more intuitive and faster to render. 
 - New concept of "random-symmetry-generators". Those are a parallel concept to random flame generators and can used in combination. 
  I.E. random-symmetry-generators apply to random-fractal a randomly-chosen-symmetry.
 - Some initial random-symmetry-generators:
    - "XAxis"
    - "YAxis" (not only differing in the axis)
    - "Point"
    - "All (sparse)" (applies symmetry only at a certain probability, this is the default)
 - re-implemented parts of the blur-shading, works different now, but also works in the interactive renderer

 - improved the "subflame"-random-generator to produce more interesting results
 - optimized some parameters of random-flame-generation to work much faster now

The latter points to an arbitrary folder on your harddisc and holds your own scripts. You can easily create and copy scripts either using the new functions in JWildfire or by just copying/creating them manually. Additionally, scripts now always contain of two files: the description (plain text) and the code (Java code)   
 - added most of the recent scripts from the JWildfire Open Group as examples
 - new path for scripts in the Preferences editor, moved the old script path (for the animation editor) into a new "Misc" category

V0.67 (20.03.2013):
 - MutaGen: an amazing new module to interactively create mutations of a certain flame. 
   There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties). 
   Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame) and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), 
   generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.  
   You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time. 
   Unlike to many other programs of this type, there is a true history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time. 
   Even if there are so many possible parameter combinations which may lead to singularies and huge computation times, the programm 
   achieves predictable computation times for each whole generation. This is done by delegating the mutation process to separate threads 
   and eventually just killing them.
 - new "sintrange" variaton by Ffey
 - new "Sort" button on the gradient transform tab (to create a new gradient which is sorted by hue and luminance)
