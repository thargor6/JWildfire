V3.40 (22.07.2018)
 - support for Java 10
 - new variations:
    - anamorphcyl (Jesus Sosa)
    - dc_kaleidotile (Brad Stefanov)
    - disc3 (Brad Stefanov)
    - glynns3subfl (Jesus Sosa)
    - gpattern (Jesus Sosa)
    - hyperbolicellipse (Jesus Sosa)
    - lazysensen (Brad Stefanov)
    - lozi (Brad Stefanov)
    - nsudoku (Jesus Sosa)
    - projective (Brad Stefanov)
    - pulse (Brad Stefanov)
    - pTransform (Rick Sidwell)
    - ringsubflame (Jesus Sosa)
    - sunflower (Jesus Sosa)
    - sunvoroni (Jesus Sosa)
    - taprats (Jesus Sosa)
    - terrain3D (Jesus Sosa)
    - vibration2 (Brad Stefanov)
    - wangtiles (Jesus Sosa)
  - updated the jsyntaxpane-library (used for syntax-highlighting while editing text) to version 1.1.5
  - increased the default font size for the script-editor inside JWildfire
  - internal optimization/API-changes: extended the API of variations:
     there is now an initOnce()-Event which is only called once for the
     first thread (unlike to init() which is called for each thread).
     This new event should be used for heavy init-operations (like loading and parsing a file).
  - the following variations use the new API and should behave more smooth (=use less memory and CPU)
    when initializing for a render:
     - wangtiles
     - terrain3D
     - dla_wf
     - dla3d_wf
     - knots3D
     - sattractor3D
  - improved the speed of the following variations:
     - dustpoint
     - knots3D
     - sattractor3D
  - deactivated (at least temporary) the following variations (because they use too much memory):
      - dragon
      - lsystem
      - ghosperisland
      - htree
      - koch
      - rsquares
      - hilbert
  - bug fixes for symmetry order and animation control updates

V3.31 (29.03.2018)
 - changed the default filter to the same that is used by Flamelet which creates nice sharp images,
   if you do not like it, you may change it in the Preferences
 - fixed the problem with the Mac-version, which could not be installed on many Macs in previous 
   versions (because the new APFS was used due to a bug in the build tool) 
 - optimed some default settings in order to allow faster editing   
 - new variations:
	- apollony (Jesus Sosa)
	- chrysanthemum (Jesus Sosa)
	- dc_dmodulus (Jesus Sosa, Rick Sidwell, and Brad Stefanov)
	- dc_gnarly (Rick Sidwell, and Brad Stefanov)
	- dustpoint (Jesus Sosa)
	- iconattractor (Jesus Sosa)
	- knots3D_js (Jesus Sosa)	
	- macmillan_js (Jesus Sosa)
	- recurrenceplot_js (Jesus Sosa)
	- seashell3D (Jesus Sosa)
	- sattractor3d (Jesus Sosa)
	- threepoint (Jesus Sosa)
	- prepost_circlize (Rick Sidwell)
	- prepost_affine (Rick Sidwell)
	- prepost_mobius (Rick Sidwell)
		---Prepost variations are executed both before the other variations (along
		with other pre_ variations) and after the other variations (along with
		other post_ variations). One of the two will be an inverse function,
		calling invtransform instead of transform. Prepost variations are
		identified with priority 2 (calls invtransform for pre and transform for
		post) or -2 (calls transform for pre and invtransform for post).---
 - updated variations:	
	- hamid_js - added more variables
	- jubiq - made it respect other 3D objects instead of making it flat
	- siercarpet_js - added preserveZ
	- parplot2d_wf - added a solid variable by default no new changes. Set to 0 they react more like traditional flames
	- pre_stabilize - Added a direct color option to pre_stabilize for coloring glitch flames
 - fixes
	- Make random gradients without fade colors use the right number of colors.
	- Bug fixes and enhancements to parameter list
		1. Pre button for variation 11 didn't work
		2. Slider for params with dynamic parameter expansion didn't work
		3. Added tool tip with full name when parameter name is truncated
	- Fix bugs with duplicate transform
		1. Final transforms now duplicate as final transforms
		2. Normal transforms now duplicate From Xaos as well as To Xaos
	- Fix UGR gradient loading for gradients saved by Ultra Fractal
		1. Newer version of Ultra Fractal don't use numnodes, so the number of
		colors it contains is used to determine whether interpolation is needed
		instead.
		2. The UGR parameter "smooth=yes" indicates that the curves used to fade
		the gradient are smoothed, not that the gradient isn't faded. The
		setColorsSmooth function was changed to reflect this.	
	- Make the "Add linked transform" button copy xaos
	- Fixed bug with dynamic parameter expansion
	- Stereo3d bug fixes
	- Made labels reflect the current edit plane
		Specifically, when the edit plane is changed, the affine labels (X1, X2,
		Y1, Y2) and the labels on the triangles (or rectangles) now change to
		match the new edit plane. This will make it easier to identify just what
		the modified values will affect.
	- Bug fix:gradient reset button breaks range editing
	- Made random gradient generator use variable widths for the colors
	
V3.30 (21.12.2017)
 - new variations:
    - dc_triTile, crop3D, spherecrop, loq

    - jubiQ, complex, quaternion 

    - lsystem_js, lsystem3D_js, lorenz_js    
    - brownian_js, dragon_js, gosperisland_js, hamid_js
    - hilbert_js, htree_js, koch_js, rsquares_js, tree_js    
    - sattractor_js, wallpaper_js, hadamard_js, crown_js
    - apocarpet_js, invtree_js,  siercarpet_js, woggle_js
    - lace_js, harmonograph_js, clifford_js, svensson_js

    - pre_stabilize to help stabilize glitch flames
    - pre_spherical, post_spherical

    - klein_group, inversion
   
 - new window to (de)active rarely used variations. When you are loading a flame (from disc or from the random generator), 
   and a deactivated variation is detected, this variation will be enabled for this flame. So, you have not to worry about
   old flames or flames made by others (using another set of variations).
   Deactivated variations are indicated by a label having a font in strikethrough style. 
   You may activate/deactivate variations at any time, in some cases you will have to reload the flame when you do this while 
   editing.

 - new "Raster"-random-flame-generator
 - new "Outlines"-random-flame-generator

 - new "Bold"-random-gradient-generator
 - changed the distribution of random gradient generators inside the "All"-random-gradient-generator (affects random flames)
 - increased flame-thumbnail-size from 90x68 to 120x68 (16:9)
 
 - Experimental "Mirror Translation" toggle-button to the Affine tab. The toggle applies to all three planes XY, YZ, and ZX. 
   When toggled on, if viewing pre-affine, changing translation (01 or 02 coefficients) is mirrored by reversing the translation 
   (setting post-affine to -01 and -02). And vice-versa if viewing post-affine. This mirroring is very handy for some of the new 
   variations I've added such as Inversion and KleinGroup and for existing variations such as Spherical, which use mathematical 
   operations that typically in other contexts are composed with a translation T and its inverse T' to move their center from the 
   origin: G_shifted = T(G(T')). A boolean is added to the transform in the flame so that the mirror toggle state is saved to 
   and restored from flame files. 

V3.21 (30.09.2017)
 - Add setBGTransparency line to scripts converted from flames. When a script creates a new flame, it sets bgTransparency to true by 
   default, so scripts converted from flames didn't preserve the setting from the flame. Added a setBGTransparency call to do so. By Rick Sidwell
 - Compatibility for addLinkedXForm. Made addLinkedXForm set the draw mode of the from xform to HIDDEN and the symmetry 
   of the to xform to 1. This matches the behavior of Apophysis, making it easier to follow tutorials for that program. By Rick Sidwell
 - New variations  (Thanks to Gregg Helt, dark-beam (Luca), Rick Sidwell and Brad Stefanov for conversions and new variations):
   - MaurerLines, MaurerRose, Minkowskope, TruchetFill, Panorama2, Panorama1, SphTiling3V2, TruchetAE, R_Circleblur, MinkQM,
     Sigmoid, BlurLinear, Gridout2, Gridout, Crob, Hole2, Cpow2, Cpow3_wf and DCCracklePWF.
   - Added Apo Cpow3 and had to rename previous Cpow3 by Gregg Helt too Cpow3_wf
   - Bugfix on isoplot variation formula 26
 - Even more work on variations, contributed by Rick Sidwell:
   - dc_cylinder
   - dc_cylinder2
   - swirl3
   - cardiod
   - shredrad
   - improved backwards-compatibility for oscilloscope and oscilloscope2   
 - experimental "UI scale"-setting in the launcher. Works only since Java9. Scales up the UI, in a consistent manner, by the given factor.
   (To use Java9: install it from oracle, then in the launcher chose "Add runtime". Navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9\bin" and select "java.exe")
   (For good results, you should reset the value of "tina.general.font_scale" in the Preferences to 1, if you used a higher value)
 - fixed the font-size of the edit-plane-buttons   

V3.20 (15.07.2017)
 - New "POINTCLOUD"-generator inside the Mesh-Generator. Pointclouds basically are meshes with 1-point-polygons. 
   In contrast to the solid meshes, the "points" of the generated point-clouds may carry also a color and an alpha channel 
   (which may be used in rendering).
        
   3D-Packages like Houdini can render point-clouds in the way that each point is represented by a little sphere 
   (you usually can adjust the size of those spheres), generating a "solid" shape.
   You can apply material to it like to any regular mesh. Especially in Houdini, the points keep their individual 
   (diffuse) color.
   
   You can also generate "solid" meshes from point-clouds, for example using the ball-pivoting-algorithm inside
   MeshLab.   
   
   Important Parameters for point-cloud-generation in JWildfire (use "Output type" POINTCLOUD to enable it):
     CELL-SIZE: the program uses an octree to quantize the space into little small cubes. All samples inside a cube
                are later condensed into one point of the point-cloud. So, this setting basically affects the 
                "resolution" of the generated mesh. But beware, please make it only smaller in small steps, 
                otherwise memory consumption may grow in an "explosive" way   
     RENDER QUALITY: overall number of samples, increase it only if your mesh has noise/holes in it  
     OUTPUT FORMAT: you may either use *.ply or *.obj. But beware, this option has also an impact on the generation
                    of the point-cloud:
                      PLY-Format: only vertices ("points"), with color and alpha channel (works good for Houdini)
                      OBJ-Format: vertices and 1-point-polygons, NO color and NO alpha channel (works good for Lightwave Hypervoxels)

  - Pressure_wave by timothy-vincent.
 - Fixes
  - Fixed issue reading apo parameters in GlynnSim variations. By Rick Sidwell
  - Fix bug reading repeated variations in a transform. By Rick Sidwell
  - Added lgamma to Math.lib for gamma variation to work.
  - Fixed some performance problem in solid rendering 
  
V3.11r2 (05.06.2017)
 - fixed a problem with calculation of normals in solid rendering

V3.11 (04.06.2017)
- New Variations 
  - Cot2_BS,Csc2_BS,Tan2_BS,Sec2_BS,Exp2_BS,Sin2_BS,Csch2_BS,Cosh2_BS,Sech2_BS,Coth2_BS,Sinh2_BS,andTanh2_BS complex variations by cothe with added variables by Brad Stefanov
  - Cosq,Sinq,Tanq,Tanhq,Coshq,Sinhq,Cotq,Cothq,Cscq,Cschq,Estiq,Secq,Sechq from the Quaternion Apo Plugin Pack by zephyrtronium implemented into JWF by Brad Stefanov
- Fixes
  - Fixed bug in TileHlp. by Brad Stefanov
  - Fixed Log_tile with new variation Tile_log for keeping compatibility ... will keep both variations since they work in different ways. By Brad Stefanov
  - Fixed bugs in XTrb by Rick Sidwell
  - Changed getCoeffxy to getXYCoeffxy for variations that use them. By Rick Sidwell
  - Fixed bugs with the Falloff3 variations. By Rick Sidwell
  - Fix misc. variation bugs. Most pre and post variations should assign, not add their results. Fixed this in multiple variations to match the original apo plugins. By Rick Sidwell
- Misc  
  - rendering/processor-usage is more smooth now, avoids blocking (may slightly decrease render speed, but is more responsive on most systems. 
    If max render speed is extremely important for you, than keep the old version) - by Andreas Maschke
  - "subflame_wf" - variation now also supports flame-sequences as input (to animate the subflame) - by Andreas Maschke  
    
V3.10 (21.04.2017)
 - Image-quality:
   - new "Filtering"-option at the Anti-Aliasing/Filtering-tab to distinguish between the various types of filtering: 
     GLOBAL_SHARPENING, GLOBAL_SMOOTHING, ADAPTIVE. The "Filter kernel" option is populated accordingly.
   - new MITCHELL_SMOOTH-filter kernel (derived from MITCHELL), which is now the default  
   - improved the behaviour of sharpening filters (causing less artifacts)
   - "Sharpness indicator" and "Low density"-parameters at the "Anti-Aliasing/Filter"-tab (affects only adaptive filtering)
   - new experimental adaptive MITCHELL_SINEPOW-filter (sharpenung details, smoothing "unsharp" areas as well as areas with low density)        
   - new "low brightness"-property to show/hide areas with lower density, increasing this value usually leads to more detail, while decreasing 
     this value may help to hide unwanted border areas
   - increased default oversampling to 2 in order to increase default quality
 
 - Editing:
   - reimplemented the preview-cache (all options at the coloring-tab do not need a recalculation do show changes). In general, all properties
     which do not need a re-render are indicated by a star at the label, e.g. "Brightness*". Is is recommended to do a quickrender before adjusting them,
     so can apply changes in almsot realtime to a decent image.
   - improved the quality of the preview in the main editor    
   - the channel-mixer also works in "realtime-mode" now   
   - new color-balancing options at the "Coloring"-tab

 - Flame-saving/flame-thumbnail-selection
   - new SaveAll-button which saves all selected flames into a single file (thanks to Michael Bourne for the suggestion)
   - new checkbox at each flame-thumbnail to (de)select it
   - new popup-menus at the flame-thumbnails (press the right mouse-button over a button to display the menu):
     - remove-button: new popup-menu to remove all or remove selected flames
     - checkbox (sometimes referred as "select-button": new popoup-menu to toggle selection or deselect all
     - added confirmation dialog to the thumbnail-delete button
 
 - Background-gradients:
   - new 2x2 gradient-type for the background of fractals , may also be changed in "realtime mode"
   - new 2x2+c gradient-type for the background of fractals (which is the new default)
   
 - Mesh-Generator: 
   - optional post-smooth (Taubin-smooth) in the mesh generator  
   - removed the parameters "Thickness mod" and "Thickness samples" (just fix your model if is has "holes") in the mesh generator 
   - improved the rotation-behaviour of the mesh-preview in the Mesh-Generator  
   - improved the heuristics to calculate "depth" when creating a mesh from a voxelstack   
   - fixed (again) a serious bug in the Mesh-Generator: when rendering image-stacks 
     each image inside a slice was the same. This causing meshes to be very 
     "chunky", depending on slice-size. (The original fix was lost due to an unknown reason)

 - Misc
   - new "Machine"-random-flame-generator
   - detect flames with invalid (xaos) settings and stop to render them
   - indicator-mode for adapative filtering (i. e. showing sharp/smooth regions)
   - fixed some labels which were not scale accordingly the global "tinaFontScale"-property
   - rearranged some controls at the coloring-tab
   - new variations, provided by Brad Stefanov ("waves2_radial", "spliptic_bs", "circlesplit", "log_tile2", "mobiq", "tile_hlp")
   - lots of new presets for the "isosfplot3d_wf"-variation, provided by Frank Baumann and Brad Stefanov
   - some performance increase on some of the DOF-blur-shapes
   - increased quality of DOF in 3D-mode, but needs much more time to compute
   - removed the color-oversampling/jittering-option
  
V3.02 (12.03.2017)
 - new and powerful "dla3d_wf"-variation ("diffusion limited aggregation") which may even utilize 3d-meshes as nodes/junctions
 - solid-random-flame-generators also make use of the "dla3d_wf"-variation
 - improved the speed of the "dla_wf"-variation
 - bugfix in the "mobiusN"-variation
 - small improvements/bugfixes

V3.01 (06.01.2017)
 - Fixed a serious bug in the Mesh-Generator: when rendering image-stacks 
   each image inside a slice was the same. This causing meshes to be very 
   "chunky", depending on slice-size. 
   The only workaround was to set slice-size to, i. e. rendering one image 
   per slice, which causes a major slowdown. 
 - minor improvement in rendering speed
 - new "isosfplot3d_wf"-variation for plotting iso-surfaces (may be very slow on old machines)
 - new "dc_color"-parameter for the "colormap_wf" and "post_colormap_wf"-variations
   to turn coloring off (in case you want only use the image as heightmap)
 - new "blend_colormap" -parameter for the "colormap_wf" and "post_colormap_wf"-variations
   to improve quality
    
V3.00 (29.11.2016)
3D SOLID RENDERING
 - completely new 3d (solid) rendering mode for flame fractals, featuring
     - ambient shadows
     - distant light-sources
     - specular lighting, several diffuse-response functions
     - reflection-mapping
     - hard and soft shadows
     - z-buffer-output

 - new "obj_mesh_wf" and "obj_mesh_primitive_wf"-variations to allow you to integrate 
   meshes as shapes into your fractals. While "obj_mesh_wf" allows you to load arbitrary
   meshes (e .g. found in the web, there are tons of free meshes out there), you may
   use "obj_mesh_primitive_wf" to use numerous predifined presets     
 - both variations support:
    - uv-colormaps
    - uv-displacement-maps
    - geometry-smoothing (using the Taubin-smooth-algorithm)        

 - new "yplot2d_wf"-, "yplot3d_wf"- and "parplot2d_wf"-variations to generate geometry
   by plotting arbitrary mathematical functions (e.g. "sin(x*x+z*z)")
 - all of those variations contain many very cool presets, e.g. there are 35 presets
   included in the "parplot2d_wf"-variaton, just slide through them by changing the 
   "preset_id"
 
 - new "plane_wf"-variation for easy creation of a textured plane
 - script-generator (which creates scripts from a flame) also creates solid-attributes 
   for solid flames
 
 - support for invisible objects which can receive shadows. This way you can let 
   fractals cast real-looking shadows on objects inside a background-image, inspired 
   by Oak Fractal Sandbox by David Byrd (http://www.davidbyrd.io/)
 - this options is supported by the variations "obj_mesh_wf", "obj_mesh_primitive_wf"
   and "plane_wf"  

 - completely new DOF for solid rendering with bokeh-effects. This DOF is a post-effect 
   (and works totally different than the regular DOF) and is not visible in the fast-preview(!). 
   But, it also gives better results.
   One way to adjust the DOF is to turn solid rendering of in order to show the regular DOF 
   in fast-preview, adjust it (position and strength), 
   and then turn solid rendering on again 

 - new "Solid Julia3D"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid (experimental)"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid (stunning)"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid Labyrinth"-random-flame-generator 
 - new option in the Prefrences to disable solid-flame-random-generators inside the global "All"-random-flame-generator

IMPROVED UI 
 - huge UI change: the main flame-window was broken into multiple smaller windows
 - new Navigator-window to make it easier to navigate between windows
 - window-state for all windows inside the desktoip is saved in the Preferences
 - new "Tips of the day"-window, may be turned off 
 - the Welcome-window (still providing some useful links) is not show per default, 
   but you can reach it in the menu
 - Customizable background and convenience-darkening effect (see 
   desktopBackgroundImagePath  and desktopBackgroundDarkenAmount in the Preferences)
 - supplied a background-image from my own library  
 - removed the combobox to select the edit-plane, and added three buttons in the 
   main editor area instead
 - new "List of changes"-window to display the list of changes made in the software 
 - improved image-quality for scaled image-display on the desktop (e. g. after 
   loading an image or displaying a rendered image)
 - option to auto-reload saved images from the interactive renderer (in order so be 
   able to check them quickly), may be turned off in the Preferences
 - option to manually save a z-buffer-image in the interactive renderer
 - buttons to easily randomize light-position and light-color (for solid flames)
 - the params in the nonlinear-tab can now get "expanded" in order to access them
   all at one time, thanks to Martin Flink to the suggestion!
 - new parameter tinaDefaultExpandNonlinearParams in the Preferences to turn the 
   expansion of the nonlinear-param-controls per default to on
 - exchanged some icons in the main editor
 - variations-editing: the controls use non-fractional step-size when changing a parameter having integer-values (like 
   power of "julia3D"-variation) 
 
GPU RENDERING
 - experimental gpu-rendering by integration of FACLRender, and external GPU
   renderer, made by Steven Brodhead (see the integrated info-window for more
   details) 
 - new info-window about GPU-rendering
 - new GPU-render window to interactively render flames, only available 
   under Windows. 
   Quick way to test out if a certain flame works, you would usually do this, 
   before you animate it, and then finally use the batch-renderer with enabled 
   GPU-renderer to render a sequence. 
 - integrated the external OpenCL-renderer in the batch-renderer
 - new option tinaFACLRenderOptions in the Preferences to influence the options 
   used to invoke the external GPU render 

MAC OS X SUPPORT
 - native installer for Mac OS
 - some optimizations for Mac OS X to improve user experience 
 - made "System" the default theme under MacOS
 - renamed the main class to JWildfire in order to get "JWildfire" displayed as application on Mac
 - changed to initial directory for the directory-select-box in the flame-browser (works now on Mac)
 - set up default resolution- and quality-profiles when no preferences file could be found

MISC
 - new "Orchids"-random-flame-generator
 
 - New local hue parameter at the Local Gamma tab (called "Gamma"), allowing much more variations in color than using only the default coloring
 - New randomizer-buttons at the Local Gamma tab, to randomize each parameter individually
 
 - added a quarter-render-size option in the Interactive Renderer

 - Removed the Shading-tab and all the options for Blur-Shading, Distance-Color-Shading and Pseudo3D-Shading. 
     - the popular blur-shading was re-introduced as new option under the "DOF / Bokeh" - tab as "Post blur"
     - distance-color-shading was removed completely, if you liked it, please keep an old version
     - Pseudo3D-shading is obsolete due to new 3d rendering   

 - removed the rarely used brightness-slider in the main editor
 - removed the rarely used Chaotica-bridge

 - recreated the SystemInfo window and added a function to clear the cache (which hold resources like fonts, meshes, ... 
   in order to speed up future calculations)
 - new "Transfer to Interactive Renderer"-button in the main editor
 - removed the MutaGen-button in the main editor

 - added two new parameters to the "subflame_wf" variation: "colorscale_z" (adds depth to the outer flame according 
   to the color-information of the inner flame) and "use_colors" (use the computed color-information of the inner 
   flame as color of the outer flame)
 - the "subflame_wf"-variation also respect hidden samples now and can recover iteration after receiving 
   invalid results (e. g. division by zero)  

 - added new parameters "axis", "centre_x", "centre_y" and "centre_y" to the "pre_wave3D_wf"-variation
 - added experimental "direct_color"-parameter to the "truchet"-variation

 - new "MobiusN"-variation by eralex

 - replaced the link to variation-guide, hosted by user FractalGee, which seems to be permanently off, by a link to 
   the variations-list supplied by Don Town 
 
 - 3 new SINEPOW-filter-kernels (with predefined power-levels)
 
 - the "Rnd"-button now can also operate on newly created flames
 
 - refined the default resolution- and quality-profiles
 
 - improved the speed of the MutaGen
 
 - changed the layout of the sub-tabs "DoF" and "Solid rendering"

 - slightly shorter startup time due to the use of more simple random-flames-generator at startup
 
 - support for loading and saving Fusion-compatible *.spl-files in the motion-curve-editor

 - moved the "Rnd"-button at a new "Misc"-tab  
     
V2.60 REVISION 2 (26.10.2015):
 - Experimental font-scale (for screens with much higher resolution)

V2.60 (12.10.2015):
 - New progressive preview, which allows progressive rendering while editing. 
   While it needs much CPU-power it is a great new way to explore interesting spots inside your fractals, it is especially of great use in combination 
   with the "Fine Edit"-option.
   It also allows you browse random-flames or flames generated by scripts at higher quality because the quality increases while you are watching at 
   the fractal.    
  
   There is a new button to toggle progressive-preview in the main-editor (you may switch between classic preview and progressive preview at any time), 
   and there is a new option in the Preferences to specify the initial state of this button (tinaEditorProgressivePreview).
   So, if you machine is too slow, you may just permanently disable it and use the default preview which was also slightly improved.
      
   There are new options tinaEditorProgressivePreviewMaxRenderTime and tinaEditorProgressivePreviewMaxRenderQuality in the Preferences to control the render-time of progressive preview.
  
 - any variation may be now be easily toggled to be pre_/normal/post_ - variation. This feature uses minimal changes in the user-interface
   and it will not break anything, e. g. all scripts should be remain intact without any further change
 - added the possiblity to change the position of variations inside a transform 

 - New "Low priority"-option in the the launcher. This options is only available under Windows and enabled by default. It should cause a general smoother behaviour of the software. 

 - providing a more advanced editor with basic syntax-highlighting for editing scripts and custom variations (thanks CozyG for the java8-related fix)
 - separate (and resizable) window for editing scripts


 - new "Batch Renderer"-button which quicksaves the current flame and sends it together with size/quality information to the batch-renderer

 - new "Reset"- and "Reset All"-buttons on the Xaos-tab
 - Optimization of preview-rendering: do not re-render flame after switching "triangles"
 - Optimization of preview-rendering: do not re-render flame after switching editor modes

 - improved the "Brokat"-random-flame-generator (uses the ability to switch variation-types, see below)
 - improved the "Simple Tiling"-random-flame-generator
 - reimplemented the "Brokat3D"-random-flame-generator to generate more visually appealing results
 - reimplemented the "Gnarl3D"-random-flame-generator to generate more visually appealing results
 - new Option "tinaAdvancedCodeEditor" in the Prefs to turn off the advanced code-editor. May not work on all systems/may not look good on all themes, especially the true dark ones.
 - the Script-From-Flame-Generator also supports flames with 3D-affine transforms
 - the Script-From-Flame-Generator also respects the new variation-priority
 - created a v6 of the Custom_Variation_Loader_GH-script by CozyG, which now used the new Prefs-option for the path and included this version as standard script
 - new property tinaCustomVariationsPath in the Prefs to specify the path for external custom_variations (used by the Custom_Variation_Loader_GH script by CozyG).
 - modifications to ScriptParamsDialog and ScriptParamsForm to keep script params modal dialog centered on JWildfire main frame. 
 - added use of tinaAdvancedCodeEditorFontSize and tinaAdvancedCodeEditorColorFix to ResourceDialog.

 - updated the Win64-distribution to java8

V2.57 (09.08.2015):
 - Major speedup in the interactive renderer
 - Tonemapping in the interactive renderer should now be exactly the same as in the fixed renderer (i.e., the final images should be the same when the quality is the same) 
 - while saving an image the rendering is paused in order to avoid to too heavy load or even freezes of the java-process
 - fixed the behaviour of the main progress-bar (was sometimes not updated)
 - Windows-Launcher:  fixed the problem with paths which contain spaces (i.e. you can now have the JWildfire-folder at any local folder, e.g. at "C:\Program Files" etc.)
 - added some Author-informations to the JWildfire.exe-file, otherwise some virus-scanner seems to be too nervous about the file ;-)
 - slightly increased the default image-quality
 - improved the "Black&White"-random-flame-generator
 - Problem fixed regarding parameter handling in the variations "trade", "w", "x", "y" and "z"

- added a brief description of all of this options in the official Wiki: http://wiki.jwildfire.org/index.php?title=Manual_RenderQualityFlameFractals

- changed the memory management/layout of the iteration buffer (rendering should now take significantly less memory, and initialisation of rendering runs substantly faster, comes to a cost of only slightly degraded render time)

- the final image-generating-process now works fully multi-threaded and should be faster
- added a new experimental option "Opacity" to control the opacity of the foreground when rendering an image with background (often those renders caused the loss of too many details)

- new "Pseudo3D"-random-flame-generator
- improved the "Xenomorph"-random-flame-generator
- improved the "Cross"-random-flame-generator

- some more useful statistics in the interactive renderer, e.g. absolute render-speed-indicator to make it easier to compare different settings (render speed means the quality level the renderer can reach in one hour)

- the windows-launcher (JWildfire.exe) should now be much smarter to find a valid Java-install
- completely removed the izpack-installer (until now there were always two files: a *.zip for users who just wanted to unzip, or an izpack-based installer which caused too many problems)
- there are now two packages available: platform-independant without jdk and any dll's, and windows64 with jdk and certain dll's   
- removed the applet from the distribution

- fixed a bug in the crop-like variations
- fixed a bug regarding autoimatically saving the current flame in the iteractive renderer
- some refactoring of the structure synthesizer
- completely removed all experimental opencl-code

V2.50 R2 (27.05.2015):
 - Added a new option tinaIntegrationChaoticaAnimationExport to the preferences. This option controls if the 
   flames which are exchanged over the Chaotica-bridge are animated flames or static flames.
   In case you export them as static flames and have not a Studio licence for Chaotica you may render in higher resolutions.
   Per default this option is set to off, i.e. exported flames are static.

 - FIXED: a problem regarding projecting invalid points (which sometimes appeared at points with random color at coordinate (0,0)), thanks to chronologicaldot for the reminder!  

V2.34 (21.02.2015):
 - powerful new sub-application to create iflames (you can reach it form the main window-menu), including a particle-simulation 
   to animate them, but please beware that this new application needs a very powerful computer,

 - you can now create your own buttons to execute your own scripts in the editor! I. E., you have in the script-tab the possibility to add a persistent 
   button to the user-interface to execute a certain script. You may, of course, cutomize it. Just select script and hit the "Add macro button"-button to add a new button to the user-interace which executes this script. You can have as many buttons as you want!

 - button for simply-generation of bokeh-like effects in the main editor - it's pure fun!
 - new "Rect"-bokeh-style
 - ability to use/create motion-curves made from mp3-audio, it has never been easier to create a sound-sync motion of a flame-fractal!
 - ability to transform (shift, scale) motion-curves in the motion-curve-dialog

 - support for actually hiding pixels which can be used from within variations to control visibility, especiall useful for cropping which really crops instead of setting points at a random position or zero
 - added a new experimental option to make the program (and the OS) more responsible while rendering. This is enabled by default. Change the property "tinaResponsibility" in the Prefs-window to tune the behaviour
 - internally reworked the strategy of the refresh of the display of the interactive renderer
 - added new scripts "Add Random Final FX by MH and MO", "Textured_Cylinders_Rev01_by_MH" and "Crackle_Styles_Chooser_Rev01_by_MH", all created  by Mick Hogan, as Standard-Scripts

 - tried to make the Interactive Renderer behave more "smooth"
 - added two new parameters to "fract_*"-variations: "z_fill" to fill the vertical gaps in 3d-mode, "z_logscale" to use log-scale in z-direction (nice for creating 3D-meshes)
 - fixed an unwanted "dot" in the "primitives_wf"-variation, when drawing a pyramid-shape
 - new experimental "xheart_blur"-variation (which bases on "xheart" by Xyrus02)
 - fixed dark background in the help-section

V1.90 (24.08.2014):
 - Motion-Curves in the Main-Editor:
    - after a long period of development I finally decided to enable the motion-curve-editor in the main editor! This means you can define 
      a motion curve (drawn with you mouse) for each flame-property to create awesome animations, using the most easy-to-use interface possible. 
      You may even add controlled motion-blur! 
      Or you can use this feature to modify different properties at the same time to find "interesting spots". The possibilities are endless :-)
      You will see a new large button to enable/disable this new features. I. E. if you dont care about animations, you will notice no change,
      unless you press this button :-)    
      A video-tutorial on all this stuff will come later...
    - preview-playback-function for the global motioncurve-editing-mode
    - automatically save the flame rendered in the interactive renderer as "jwf_ir_current.flame" (like an auto quicksave). So, in case of a rare crash you will always keep you latest flame in the IR.
      
 - Mesh-Generator:
    - new Option to skip slices in the mesh-generating-process  
    - added some image-pre-filtering-options to modify (smooth) the generated slices 
    - some experimental option to thicken details, may get obsolete by using the pre-filters (requires more testing, any feedback is welcome)
    - Created an official JWildfire-shop at shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/jwildfire (It is not about making money, just to show what 
      the mesh-generator can do. But you can also buy this stuff, of course, I have tried to make the prices as fair as possible)  
    
 - Other changes:
    - improved the speed and "smoothness" of the interactive renderer
    - extended the "mandelbrot"-variation by three params: "seed" (allowing fixed random shapes which may be better animated), "max_points" (to specify the number of fixed major points which build the shape, good if you plan to increase the surface by using a blur-variation) and "rnd_z_range" (specify a range at the z-direction where the major points get distributed, can lead to much more interesting models)
    - added new shape TRIANGLE and PYRAMID to "primitives_wf"-variation (right, it is now easy to build the pyramids :D)
    - fixed the encoding of the start_mac.command file, thanks again to Matthew Townsend
    - new "sph3D"-variation by Xyrus02
    - added the methode getCurrLayer() to the script-runner-interface
    - some additions to the FAQ-section    
    
V1.80 (10.08.2014):
 - new module to generate meshes from 3d-flame-fractals! The module consists of three parts: 
     - a volumetric renderer
     - a mesh generator which uses the marching-cubes-algorithm to generate a mesh from a stack of rendered images
     - a previewer which can either create a quick-preview by some internal renderer or a high quality-preview by using the integrated sunflow-renderer 
   In comparison to some other solutions the module has the following strengths: 
     - it works multi-threaded and has decent speed
     - it creates not only vertices, but also vertex normals
     - it is able to process really huge meshes, if you have enough memory
     - the mesh-generator supports additional smoothing and can process any image-stack in the formats supported by JWildfire. So probably you could also convert Mandelbulb3D Voxelstack by using this modeule (I have not tried it, so any feedback is welcome) 
     - it is extensible and open source   
 - restructured the Help/About-section, updated some informations, added an Aphophysis-users-hints-page
 - improved the "Strong hue"-random-color-generator to produce more interesting results
 - black-border-fix for the "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "log_db"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "asteria"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "ztwister"-variation by dark-beam
 - made the "custom_wf"-variations more robust to errors. If an error occurs during regular calculation (e.g. after loading a flame with errors in the java-code) the variation does nothing. If you edit the code, you cant save it until you fixed the error
 - improved start-script for Macs by Matthew Townsend
 - new fluent-API to create sunflow-scenes (only interesting for developers)

V1.70 (06.07.2014):
 - new tab for local modification of gamma, contrast and saturation on a transform-basis. 
   Those work similiar to the color values ("color" and "color-speed"), but they control changes in applied color values, 
   rather than specifying color values themselfs. This is a true new addition to the Flame Fractal Algorithm itself, 
   and makes it much more easy to create flame fractals with more depth, without the need of endless fiddling with the gradient :-)

 - improved the smoothness of modifying parameters by dragging the mouse by about factor 2.5
 - the "Fine"-adjustment is now also taken into account when modifying parameters by dragging the mouse. If the "Fine"-button is enabled all changes have a increased smoothness (precision) by factor 10.      
 - new experimental and super-cool "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "loonie2" and "loonie3"-variation by dark-beam

 - new "Strong hue"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Smooth"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Monochrome"-random-gradient-generator

 - new "saturation"-setting under "Coloring" (which affects the saturation of the final image. A saturation of 1.0 is the default value. Lower values decrease saturation, i. E. the fractals appears more "gray", higher values add more levels of "color" )

 - new "color map"-random-flame-generator, using randomly chosen images from your image-collection as color-map (you must specify the base-path in the prefs, but please BEWARE that this path is scanned recursively, so please check if you have any "forbidden" images there). This generator is NOT included in the "All"-random-flame-generator, so it must be selected explicitely

 - new "Move to"/"Copy to"-functions in the flame browser

     - motions in the Easy Movie Maker now respect the FPS setting (rather than calculating the speed by the total number of frames)
     - removed *_NEG animation-scripts, refactoring of the Easy Movie Maker
 - additional camera-controls (x-, y- and z-position), this makes it possible to create really "different" images!  
 - new "dc_hexes_wf" variation, which is derived from the well-known "hexes"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information 
 - new "dc_crackle_wf variation, which is derived from the well-known "crackle"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information   
 - new SIDE_BY_SIDE_FULL-preview-mode for stereo3d images (uses larger preview area)
 - new option to easily swap sides in stereo3d-rendering
 - 5 new "What does this button do?"-tutorials from Naomi Richmond

 - changed the camera handling: in 3d-flames there is now a real 3d camera, in 2d flames there is a 2d-camera. (In previous releases there was a "mixed" mode of 2D camera roll and 3D pith and yaw, as introduced by the famous "3d hack" invented by Zueuk)
 - added post-symmetry-support for the script-from-flame-generator

 - removed the JWildfireC sub project (will be replaced by some OpenCL-based stuff later)

V1.30 (02.03.2014):
 - New concept of "post-symmetries". A post symmetry is something like a "final transform after a final transform". 
 But unlike to a ordinary final transform it can clone samples and modify those clones, making it very efficient to create fractals with certain symmetry.
 For example, for a mirror-like-symmetry it creates for any input sample one mirrored clone.        
 You also could achieve this by designing the fractal, but using the post-symmetries makes it much more intuitive and faster to render. 
 - New concept of "random-symmetry-generators". Those are a parallel concept to random flame generators and can used in combination. 
  I.E. random-symmetry-generators apply to random-fractal a randomly-chosen-symmetry.
 - Some initial random-symmetry-generators:
    - "XAxis"
    - "YAxis" (not only differing in the axis)
    - "Point"
    - "All (sparse)" (applies symmetry only at a certain probability, this is the default)
 - re-implemented parts of the blur-shading, works different now, but also works in the interactive renderer

 - simple native laucher (JWildfire.exe) for the launcher for Windows 
 - improved the speed of the editor for various operations

The latter points to an arbitrary folder on your harddisc and holds your own scripts. You can easily create and copy scripts either using the new functions in JWildfire or by just copying/creating them manually. Additionally, scripts now always contain of two files: the description (plain text) and the code (Java code)

 - updated the link to the new JWildfire Open Group in the welcome-screen

V0.67 (20.03.2013):
 - MutaGen: an amazing new module to interactively create mutations of a certain flame. 
   There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties). 
   Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame) and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), 
   generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.  
   You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time. 
   Unlike to many other programs of this type, there is a true history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time. 
   Even if there are so many possible parameter combinations which may lead to singularies and huge computation times, the programm 
   achieves predictable computation times for each whole generation. This is done by delegating the mutation process to separate threads 
   and eventually just killing them.
 - new "sintrange" variaton by Ffey
 - new "Sort" button on the gradient transform tab (to create a new gradient which is sorted by hue and luminance)
 - the view is now centered after starting a render in the interactive renderer

 - gradient and shading options can now also accessed in the dancing flames module
 - improved the performance of the Mersenne Twister random number generator

V0.65 (24.02.2013):
 - new "dimishZ" property to create more realistic looking pseudo-3D-renders
 - dropped the concept of the external renders! The only remaining benefit of the external renders was the lower memory consumption, but this problem was ales solved in this release!
 - added an abstraction level to iteration rasters. There are currently two implementations available: single and double precision. Double precision was the previously used, but single precision need less memory and leeds to te same results in many cases, so its the new default. But you can change this in the preferences
 - the thumbnails can now be loaded into the main area also by single right click with the mouse (as suggested by Don Town)

 - random flame generator: create sorted gradients sorted by hue at a certain probability
 - FIXED: vibrancy and contrast where not (re)stored using *flame-files correctly
 - FIXED: the use of custom_wf variation did cause the editor to stop (because the example code could not be compiled anymore (which was an cause of all those changes to MathLib))
 - FIXED: some params were not read correctly in the circlecrop family of variations
 - FIXED: bug regarding blur shading (also already fixed in V0.64 revision 2)

V0.64 (16.02.2013):
