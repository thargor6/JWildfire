V6.00 (xx.xx.2020)
 - dramatic improvement of responsiveness to changes in the UI (sliders, number fields, ...)
 - faster Undo and Randomizers as well (see below)
 - automatic creation and updating of keyframes when changing flame-parameters at different frame-numbers, creating
   of flame-animations has never been easier
 - there are the following functions in the UI to deal with keyframes:
     -jump to previous keyframe (takes all keyframes of all motions curves into account and jumps to the closest keyframe)
     -jump to next keyframe (same as before, but in the opposite direction)
     -delete current keyframe (affects all motion curves which contain a corresponding keyframe)
     -duplicate current keyframe (affects all motion curves which contain a corresponding keyframe)
     -reset all motion curves/remove all keyframes
 - easy revert-to-default-feature for most parameters: just double-click at the label in front of an field to revert the
   current-value to the default value. To see if a field supprots this feature, just hover with the mouse of the label.
   When the cursor turn into a hand-symbol, the field supports the feature. This function also respects motion-curves and can be undone.

 - changed some default settings in regard to flame-animations
 - numeric fields now also react to inputs of the mousewheel
 - added function to reset all motion curves
 - re-implemented animation-playback in the main editor
 - new settings in the Preferences for animation preview in the main editor: tinaRenderAnimPreviewQuality (render quality) and tinaRenderAnimPreviewSize (size of preview)
 - new setting in the Preferences for default state of the animation-controls in the main editor: tinaDefaultAnimationControlsEnabled (per default: true)
 - renamed the "Misc"-tab into "Randomize", moved the "Randomize weighting-fields"-button to this tab, added also a hint-panel
 - added motion curves for the following flame-parameters: balancingRed/Green/Blue, lowDensityBrightness and foregroundOpacity
 - added new property "tinaDefaultFrameCount" to the Preferences, here you can change the default number of frames for a flame-animation,
   created in the main editor

V5.50 (21.12.2019)
 - New "Curve Editor" for gradients at the gradient tab. This gives much more control over the final result because it allows a very interactive editing
   of the gradient and the flame at the same time. Additionally, it allows more direct control over modifying the colors of a gradient,
   making it much easier to create "dramatic" effects.

   Internally, each gradient now consist both of the "classic" part of the gradient and three new curves: hue, saturation and luminosity.
   Those curves belong to the flames, and are also stored within the flame-files.

   When loading an old flame without those curves, or assigning a "classic" gradient to a flame, the color curves are approximated.
   This usually is only a very raw approximation, but this is absolutely intended. To reach a very accurate approximation, it would require
   to have a lot of curve-points, which would make the curve very hard to edit.

   So, there is no exact synchronisation between the gradient and the colors curves, in order to not break existing flames and concepts.
   Instead, it is meant as powerful additional tool, whioch is useful in very many cases, but might not be useful in each case.

   Only when you start to edit one of the curves, the gradient is synchronized to shape of the curves. When you save and re-load a flame
   you can continue the editing of the curves.

   Each curve has a toolbar with little buttons to help with editing:
     - open a modal dialog for editing an enlarged version of a particular curve
     - create ramp-shaped curve
     - create line-shaped curve at the bottom (constant zero intensity)
     - create line-shaped curve at the middle (constant halve intensity)
     - mirror the curve at the vertical axis
     - mirror the curve at the horizontal axis (e.g., to turn a constant line of zero intensity into a line with maximum intensity)

   Two new random-gradient-generators directly support the concept of color-curves. I. e., they create random color-curves instead of random gradients.
   All existing random-gradient-generators works as before. I.e., they create only random gradients, while the color-curves are approximated from
   the gradients.

 - new "Uneven curves"-random-gradient-generator, which generated both a color-curve and a gradient (derived from this color-curve)

 - new "Uniform curves"-random-gradient-generator, which generated both a color-curve and a gradient (derived from this color-curve)

 - made "Uneven curves" the new default random-gradient-generator

 - New coloring type (by Rick Sidwell):
 	CYCLIC shifts the gradient index right by the amount specified by Speed,
    wrapping as needed to cycle through gradient colors. It doesn't converge
    to a color when iterated, so some other transform needs to use DIFFUSION
    to get a stable color that CYCLIC can use as a starting point.
    CYCLIC is especially useful for coloring tilings.

 - function to create a simular gradient (using the currently loaded gradient as reference)

 - new "EDisc"-random-flame-generator

 - new "Save Gradient"-button at the gradient-tab

 - new "Random Gradient"-button direct at the gradient-tab

 - new variations (no particular order):
    - octapol (by xyrus02)

 - added "Lumiere Scripts" by Michael Bourne (a collection of 22 scripts) as built-in scripts
 - added "The Yugen Scripts" by Michael Bourne (a collection of 17 scripts) as built-in scripts
 - added "Keep 'Em Separated and Framed Script" by Brad Stefanov as built-in scripts
 - added "Minkowscope Painting Script" by Brad Stefanov as built-in scripts

 - fixed a nasty bug which could cause the final image to contain black stripes

 - Making a variaton a pre or post now works as intended

 - added standard shortcuts to Undo/Redo (<Strg>+Z/Y)

 - slighlty increased variation cost threshold to increase diversity in random flames

 - small optimization of the space at WField-tab

 - new README-file with hints for Linux-users

 - Additional presets added to isosfplot3d_wf variation
 
 - Two modes added to jubiQ variation
 
 - New option to specify color for DiminishZ; this is useful when using DiminishZ with a colored background
 
 - New coloring types descriptions in the Fractal Flames: Help window
 
 - New Density option for layers (by Rick Sidwell).
   Layer density allows fading some layers with respect to others to better
   balance the overall flame. It is complimentary to Weight, which controls
   the intensity of the layer to balance its brightness, but can only make
   it darker, not less dense.
 
 - New layer Extract button extracts the selected layer to a new flame in the editor
 
 - New ZBuffer controls (by Rick Sidwell)
   - ZBuffer bias makes the background appear closer. This is sometimes needed when using the ZBuffer
     for 3D photos in Facebook, which creates white splotches if the background is too far away.
   - ZBuffer filename option to select between traditional zbuf_name and name_depth (what Facebook requires).

 - New Camera tab Bank control to rotate flame around the Y axis. This rotation is normally called Roll, 
   but that name is already used; Bank is a synonym. It works in conjunction with Pitch (rotate around X
   axis) and Yaw (rotate around Z axis).

 - New FastNoiseCreator in Image Processing to create images containing various types of noise
 
 - Change Easy movie maker FADE function to better fade between flames. A compatibility option allows using the old method.
 
 - Tooltips added to many controls

 - Rick Sidwell: Various fixes, including one that prevented the Mesh generator from working.
     1. Added some null pointer checks to AnimationService.java
     2. Removed print statement from Variation.java (only noticable if
     started from the command line for debugging)
     3. Fixed BokehOptionsBuggon tooltip text
     4. Corrected class for PerlinNoiseCreator so Transformation expression
     can be edited
     5. Camera distance field now allows negative distances.
     6. Motion curve for Fade to white now works.
     7. Edit gradient now puts focus on gradient so cursor keys work.
     8. Make a copy of a thumbnail flame before appending it as a layer to avoid confusing situations when editing one flame changes another.

V5.00 (28.06.2019)
 - Introducing a new artistic concept to flame-fractals: weighting-fields.
   I had this in mind for a while, but never found the time to really "grasp" it.
   When you look at my fractal art, you will notice that I'm usually striving for a very energetic and organic style.
   Flame fractals support this style a lot, but I'm was often looking for "more".

   Finally, weighting-fields are the implementation of what I was looking for.
   The basic idea: to add some kind of "natural disturbances" at the transform-level of the flame-fractals.
   But, allow that in a very artistic way by just modulating an existing fractal shape. Allow to easily try out if different "styles".
   You may choose between different types of this kind of disturbance, for example "Perlin Fractal Noise" for a very organic style.
   But, you can also load image-maps (photographs) for very individual styles. Each style comes with a lot of options to tweak.

   You may chose a weighting-field at the transform-level. So you may even combine different weighting-fields inside one fractal in non-destructive-way.

   Currently, the following fractal-parameters may be affected by a weighting-field:
   - variation-amount
   - variation-parameter-amount (for up to three parameters per transform, like frequency of a waves-trandform)
   - color-index (allows subtle color-changing effects)

   With version 5.00, weighting-fields are integrated into JWildfire as "first-class-citizen":
   - there is some new "weighting-field"-aspect inside random-flame-generators (similar to random-symmetry-generators or random-gradient-generators).
     Currently, there are 6 built-in random-weighting-field generators. The default one is "All, sparse", which means to randomly generate weighting-field-aspects,
     but only for a few random flames.
   - there is new Mutation-type WEIGHT_FIELD inside MutaGen
   - there is a new "WField"-tab under the "Transformations"-tab,where you can create, edit and generate weighting-field-related effects.
   - scripting is completely supported
   - by design, the performance-impact is moderate, and you may even animate weighting-fields

   To get started, just load a favourite flame of yours and the press the new "WFld"-button at the left of the preview-area.
   Repeat it multiple times to see what is possible.
   To see what is going on, select a transform and enter the "WField"-tab under the "Transformations"-tab.
   Have a look at the options and see how they change when you press the "WField"-button. Play with them while changing them manually.

   You may also randomize the weighting-fields-params of one transform. Just selectt the transform, uncheck the "Whole fractal"-option at the "WField"-tab and
   hit the "Randomize all"-button at the "WField"-tab or the "WFld"-button at the preview area.

   To generate random-flames with weighting-fields always enabled, change the "WField"-setting at the upper left of the main editor from "(All, sparse)" to "(All)"
   and hit the "Random batch"-button.

 - Improved performance and stability due to an internal mechanism to evaluate costs of variations/plugins.
   There are three types of cost: initialization time, calculation time and memory consumption.
   JWildfire will prefer variations with low costs for performing "randomization-tasks" like generating random-flames.
   There will be even variations/plugins which become completely "counted out" and never be touched in such operations.
   This will improve general performance and stability, but also give variation/plugin-developers additional the freedom.
   They may try out new things freely, without the danger of compromising the whole application.

 - new option to specify the number of random-flames, generated during program-start (tina.initial_random_batch.size, defaults to 3)
 
 - new color_mode option in subflame_wf: -2 will use the actual subflame color (using the subflame's gradient or other coloring).

 - new coloring types, provided by Rick Sidwell:
   TARGET ignores the gradient, but uses a specific color that can be set    by clicking a new TargetColor button. The new color 
   is interpolated from the current color and the target color. Speed works the same as with DIFFUSION coloring; -1 sets the new 
   color to the target color, 1 doesn't change the color, and 0 sets the new color halfway between the current and target colors.

   TARGETG works just like TARGET, but the gradient is used to select the target color, allowing it to be easily changed by changing 
   or shifting the gradient. But the intermediate gradient colors are not used.

   These coloring types can create very smooth color changes in flames, and also work with variations that set the RGB color values 
   directly.
   
   DISTANCE uses the gradient indexed by the distance the transform moved the point. Color determines the starting point and Speed 
   controls how far along the gradient each unit of distance moves from there. Like other coloring types, Speed -1 sets the color
   to the specified color. The input color is ignored, so unlike the others Speed 1 will still change the color.

   DISTANCE is especially effective for coloring flames made with a single non-blur transform (blur transforms ignore the input point,
   so the distance and thus the color of each point is random).

 - new COLOR_TYPE-Mutation for MutaGen to randomly apply the new color-types (NONE, DIFFUSION, TARGET, TARGETG, DISTANCE)\
 
 - spaces in gradient names are converted to underscores so the entire gradient name is now visible in the gradient list.

 - significant performance-improvement in the refreshing-behaviour in the UI, you especially notive this when changing variations in the "Nonlinear"-tab

 - new way of resetting params of variations to their defaults (as suggested by Michael Bourne):
     - double-click at the "Var x"-label to reset all parameters to their defaults
     - double click at a specific param-label to reset it's value to the default value (you need expand the param-panel to access the labels)
   Please note, that there are some parameters which have random defaults.

 - this way of resetting params may also used at the "WField"-tab (but is not available at all other places, yet).


 - Rick added added some new tips to TipsOfTheDay.html, and a new preference to remember the last tip shown at startup and display the next one at the next startup.

 - New variation: dc_code by Jesus Sosa
 - Enhancements to dc_ variations by Jesus Sosa
 - Tips for Apophysis users (in Fractal flames: Help window) updated
 - Preference tinaCustomVariationsPath is now used for custom_wf and custom_wf_full

 - New Color Type feature
   There are now two coloring types, selectable per transform on the Color tab:
     NONE (the default for final transforms) does not change the color; this is the way final transforms have traditionally 
     worked in JWildfire
     DIFFUSION (the default for normal transforms) uses the Color and Speed settings with the gradient; this is the standard 
     method for coloring flames.
   Changing the Color Type for final transforms to DIFFUSION allows final transforms to adjust the colors, as it does in other 
   flame programs.
   Changing the Color Type for normal transforms to NONE allows them to manipulate true color (rgbColor) variations without 
   sucking the color away.

V4.00 revision 2 (20.12.2018)
  - fixed a bug regarding calculating the offset in tone-mapping (causing the final image shifted under certain circumstances)
  - fixed a bug regarding mouse-sync while dragging triangles or control-points with mouse
  - minor improvement of the smoothness of the realtime-display
  - minor optimization to the renderer
  - minor fix regarding caching of render-buffer
  - new variations by Whittaker Courtney:
    - tile_reverse
    - sqrt_acoth
    - sqrt_acosh
    - sqrt_asech
    - sqrt_atanh
    - sqrt_asinh
    - sqrt_acosech

V4.00 (17.12.2018)
 - dramatically improved the smootheness of the real-time-editing: while dragging the mouse, the view is constantly updated,
   reflecting the change of the fractal. When you only see black editing-area, then often the fractal is changing too rapidly,
   just move slowlier to see the shape evolving, or wait a moment, while still having the left mouse-button pressed
   - reduded the change-rate when editing affine controls
 - new "Quilt Renderer"-module to render flames in nearly unlimited size. This works by splitting the whole image into tiles.
   You may freely specify how the tiles are generited, e.g. splitting the image in 3x2 tiles or 8 vertical stripes.
   Each of the rendered tiles is a valid image. So, even JWildfire would finally fail to assemble the tiles into one
   final image (due to memory restrictions), you could perform this step using external image-processing-software,
   which is more optimized to handle large images. But images with a size upto 32K (30720x17280) where tested
   without any problems so far. You can cancel/resume the rendering-process at tile-level.
   Please note: Due to the nature of the flame-fractal-algorithm, the rendering of each tile may take as long as you
   would render the whole image at once. So, this method is not efficient, but effective.
   A 16K render on a modern computer can take about 12 hours, but you will usually get an awesome result with endless details.
 - new button to easily import-scripts at the "Scripts and Custom-Buttoms"-tab. This function accepts all *.zip-files containing at least one
   script file (with the extension *.jwfscript). Associated text-files (descriptions) and any *.ugr-gradients are imported as well.
   Any other files are ignored. If the *.zip-file contains sub-folders, only the scripts inside the folders are extracted, but not
   the folder-structure itself. The function warns before overwriting files.
 - the flame-thumbnails on the left may now be properly scrolled using the mousewheel
 - selecting (double- or right-clicking) a frame from the thumbnail-bar now works much more reliable

 - new GLSL-family of variations by Jesus Sosa:
   After implementing a set of java functions that simulate almost the bunch of functions used in GLSL code for fragment shaders,

    - glsl_grid3D
    - glsl_hyperbolictile
    - glsl_squares
    - glsl_code (to try out own stuff)
 - updated variations:
    - splits (new shear-parameters, Dark Beam, Brad Stefanov)
 - many awesome scripts, provided my Michael Bourne:
    - "UmmaGumma"-scripts (see new scripts starting with "UG-" in "Built-In-scripts"-category)
    - "Hubble"-scripts (see new scripts starting with "HB-" in "Built-In-scripts"-category)
    - "Samhain Splits"-scripts (see new scripts starting with "SX-" in "Built-In-scripts"-category)
 - removed the dialog-options from the following built-in scripts, so they can executed in a more quick and simple
   manner (required paramerers are chosen randomly,  instead of asking the user):
    - "Oily_Juliascope_Rev1"
    - "Oily_Rev3"
    - "Plastic"
    - "HypertilePoincare_Rev2"
    - "SphericalCross_Rev2"
    - "SuperSusan_Rev1"
    - "Textured_Cylinders_Rev01_by_MH"
    - "TomsSpiralSpiral_Rev3"
 - scripts can also be executed by simply double-clicking at them
 - new "JulianRings"-random-flame-generator
 - Main-Editor: there are now new three buttons at the left to easily open Interactive Renderer, Movie-Maker or Flame-Browser
   (the two buttons "Send to IR" and "Send to MovieMaker" are replaced by them)
 - new "reset clr"-button the "Gradient"-tab to reset all color-values and color-speed-values to 0
 - render-priority in the ui should now be set to low
 - bug-fix regarding rendering with enabled post-symmetry (Rick Sidwell):
     When Post symmetry is enabled, the result of clicking Render was dimmer
     than using Interactive Render, especially with large Symmetry order
     values. This change makes Render Fractal and Interactive Render produce
     the same results when Post symmetry is enabled.
 - bug fix EasyMovieMaker:
     when using multiple flames to morph between the slider at the bottom covered the edit, replace, remove buttons
 - internal scripts may provide their own gradients now
 - Moved the "Misc"-tab to the bottom, the "Script"-tab was renamed into "Scripts and Custom-Buttoms" to give it more attention
 - Improved the "Solid Labyrinth"-random-flame-generator
 - contributed two new images to the Launcher

V3.50 (28.07.2018)
 - removed the desktop and the Navigator-window in order to simplify and speed-up the user-interface
 - faster app-startup, there are now 3 random flames generated at start (and it is still faster than before)
 - improved the resize-behaviour/speed of the main-editor-window
 - support for Java 10 (Please note, that JWildfire still works with Java 8 and Java 8 ist still supported by Oracle.
   But, Java 10 is also supported now, and when you want to use the UI-scaling-feature, you will need Java 10.)
 - many new variations:
    - affine3D (ported from Flamelet)
    - anamorphcyl (Jesus Sosa)
    - dc_kaleidotile (Brad Stefanov)
    - disc3 (Brad Stefanov)
    - glynns3subfl (Jesus Sosa)

    - pTransform (Rick Sidwell)
    - q_ode (Brad Stefanov)
    - ringsubflame (Jesus Sosa)
    - sunflower (Jesus Sosa)
    - sunvoroni (Jesus Sosa)
    - taprats (Jesus Sosa)
    - terrain3D (Jesus Sosa)
    - vibration2 (Brad Stefanov)
    - wangtiles (Jesus Sosa)
  - new "Affine3D"-random-flame-generator (also taken from Flamelet)
  - updated the jsyntaxpane-library (used for syntax-highlighting while editing text) to version 1.1.5
  - increased the default font size for the script-editor inside JWildfire
  - internal optimization/API-changes: extended the API of variations:
     there is now an initOnce()-Event which is only called once for the
     first thread (unlike to init() which is called for each thread).
     This new event should be used for heavy init-operations (like loading and parsing a file).
  - the following variations use the new API and should behave more smooth (=use less memory and CPU)
    when initializing for a render:
     - wangtiles
     - terrain3D
     - dla_wf
     - dla3d_wf
     - knots3D
     - sattractor3D
  - improved the speed of the following variations:
     - dustpoint
     - knots3D
     - sattractor3D
  - improved the stability of the following variations (Rick Sidwell):
      - brownian_js
      - dragon_js
      - glynnsim3
      - ghosperisland
      - hilbert_js
      - htree_js
      - koch_js
      - lsystem_js
      - rsquares_js
      - tree_js
  - new property tinaLSystemMaxLength in the prefs to specify maximum size of the generated string for the L-System variation (lsystem_js)
  - bug fixes for symmetry order and animation control updates
  - fixed a bug regarding rendering motion-blur

V3.31 (29.03.2018)
 - changed the default filter to the same that is used by Flamelet which creates nice sharp images,
   if you do not like it, you may change it in the Preferences
 - fixed the problem with the Mac-version, which could not be installed on many Macs in previous 
   versions (because the new APFS was used due to a bug in the build tool) 
 - optimed some default settings in order to allow faster editing   
 - new variations:
	- apollony (Jesus Sosa)
	- chrysanthemum (Jesus Sosa)
	- dc_dmodulus (Jesus Sosa, Rick Sidwell, and Brad Stefanov)
	- dc_gnarly (Rick Sidwell, and Brad Stefanov)
	- dustpoint (Jesus Sosa)
	- iconattractor (Jesus Sosa)
	- knots3D_js (Jesus Sosa)	
	- macmillan_js (Jesus Sosa)
	- recurrenceplot_js (Jesus Sosa)
	- seashell3D (Jesus Sosa)
	- sattractor3d (Jesus Sosa)
	- threepoint (Jesus Sosa)
	- prepost_circlize (Rick Sidwell)
	- prepost_affine (Rick Sidwell)
	- prepost_mobius (Rick Sidwell)
		---Prepost variations are executed both before the other variations (along
		with other pre_ variations) and after the other variations (along with
		other post_ variations). One of the two will be an inverse function,
		calling invtransform instead of transform. Prepost variations are
		identified with priority 2 (calls invtransform for pre and transform for
		post) or -2 (calls transform for pre and invtransform for post).---
 - updated variations:	
	- hamid_js - added more variables
	- jubiq - made it respect other 3D objects instead of making it flat
	- siercarpet_js - added preserveZ
	- parplot2d_wf - added a solid variable by default no new changes. Set to 0 they react more like traditional flames
	- pre_stabilize - Added a direct color option to pre_stabilize for coloring glitch flames
 - fixes
	- Make random gradients without fade colors use the right number of colors.
	- Bug fixes and enhancements to parameter list
		1. Pre button for variation 11 didn't work
		2. Slider for params with dynamic parameter expansion didn't work
		3. Added tool tip with full name when parameter name is truncated
	- Fix bugs with duplicate transform
		1. Final transforms now duplicate as final transforms
		2. Normal transforms now duplicate From Xaos as well as To Xaos
	- Fix UGR gradient loading for gradients saved by Ultra Fractal
		1. Newer version of Ultra Fractal don't use numnodes, so the number of
		colors it contains is used to determine whether interpolation is needed
		instead.
		2. The UGR parameter "smooth=yes" indicates that the curves used to fade
		the gradient are smoothed, not that the gradient isn't faded. The
		setColorsSmooth function was changed to reflect this.	
	- Make the "Add linked transform" button copy xaos
	- Fixed bug with dynamic parameter expansion
	- Stereo3d bug fixes
	- Made labels reflect the current edit plane
		Specifically, when the edit plane is changed, the affine labels (X1, X2,
		Y1, Y2) and the labels on the triangles (or rectangles) now change to
		match the new edit plane. This will make it easier to identify just what
		the modified values will affect.
	- Bug fix:gradient reset button breaks range editing
	- Made random gradient generator use variable widths for the colors
	
V3.30 (21.12.2017)
 - new variations:
    - dc_triTile, crop3D, spherecrop, loq

    - jubiQ, complex, quaternion 

    - lsystem_js, lsystem3D_js, lorenz_js    
    - brownian_js, dragon_js, gosperisland_js, hamid_js
    - hilbert_js, htree_js, koch_js, rsquares_js, tree_js    
    - sattractor_js, wallpaper_js, hadamard_js, crown_js
    - apocarpet_js, invtree_js,  siercarpet_js, woggle_js
    - lace_js, harmonograph_js, clifford_js, svensson_js

    - pre_stabilize to help stabilize glitch flames
    - pre_spherical, post_spherical

    - klein_group, inversion
   
 - new window to (de)active rarely used variations. When you are loading a flame (from disc or from the random generator), 
   and a deactivated variation is detected, this variation will be enabled for this flame. So, you have not to worry about
   old flames or flames made by others (using another set of variations).
   Deactivated variations are indicated by a label having a font in strikethrough style. 
   You may activate/deactivate variations at any time, in some cases you will have to reload the flame when you do this while 
   editing.

 - new "Raster"-random-flame-generator
 - new "Outlines"-random-flame-generator

 - new "Bold"-random-gradient-generator
 - changed the distribution of random gradient generators inside the "All"-random-gradient-generator (affects random flames)
 - increased flame-thumbnail-size from 90x68 to 120x68 (16:9)
 
 - Experimental "Mirror Translation" toggle-button to the Affine tab. The toggle applies to all three planes XY, YZ, and ZX. 
   When toggled on, if viewing pre-affine, changing translation (01 or 02 coefficients) is mirrored by reversing the translation 
   (setting post-affine to -01 and -02). And vice-versa if viewing post-affine. This mirroring is very handy for some of the new 
   variations I've added such as Inversion and KleinGroup and for existing variations such as Spherical, which use mathematical 
   operations that typically in other contexts are composed with a translation T and its inverse T' to move their center from the 
   origin: G_shifted = T(G(T')). A boolean is added to the transform in the flame so that the mirror toggle state is saved to 
   and restored from flame files. 

V3.21 (30.09.2017)
 - Add setBGTransparency line to scripts converted from flames. When a script creates a new flame, it sets bgTransparency to true by 
   default, so scripts converted from flames didn't preserve the setting from the flame. Added a setBGTransparency call to do so. By Rick Sidwell
 - Compatibility for addLinkedXForm. Made addLinkedXForm set the draw mode of the from xform to HIDDEN and the symmetry 
   of the to xform to 1. This matches the behavior of Apophysis, making it easier to follow tutorials for that program. By Rick Sidwell
 - New variations  (Thanks to Gregg Helt, dark-beam (Luca), Rick Sidwell and Brad Stefanov for conversions and new variations):
   - MaurerLines, MaurerRose, Minkowskope, TruchetFill, Panorama2, Panorama1, SphTiling3V2, TruchetAE, R_Circleblur, MinkQM,
     Sigmoid, BlurLinear, Gridout2, Gridout, Crob, Hole2, Cpow2, Cpow3_wf and DCCracklePWF.
   - Added Apo Cpow3 and had to rename previous Cpow3 by Gregg Helt too Cpow3_wf
   - Bugfix on isoplot variation formula 26
 - Even more work on variations, contributed by Rick Sidwell:
   - dc_cylinder
   - dc_cylinder2
   - swirl3
   - cardiod
   - shredrad
   - improved backwards-compatibility for oscilloscope and oscilloscope2   
 - experimental "UI scale"-setting in the launcher. Works only since Java9. Scales up the UI, in a consistent manner, by the given factor.
   (To use Java9: install it from oracle, then in the launcher chose "Add runtime". Navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9\bin" and select "java.exe")
   (For good results, you should reset the value of "tina.general.font_scale" in the Preferences to 1, if you used a higher value)
 - fixed the font-size of the edit-plane-buttons   

V3.20 (15.07.2017)
 - New "POINTCLOUD"-generator inside the Mesh-Generator. Pointclouds basically are meshes with 1-point-polygons. 
   In contrast to the solid meshes, the "points" of the generated point-clouds may carry also a color and an alpha channel 
   (which may be used in rendering).
        
   3D-Packages like Houdini can render point-clouds in the way that each point is represented by a little sphere 
   (you usually can adjust the size of those spheres), generating a "solid" shape.
   You can apply material to it like to any regular mesh. Especially in Houdini, the points keep their individual 
   (diffuse) color.
   
   You can also generate "solid" meshes from point-clouds, for example using the ball-pivoting-algorithm inside
   MeshLab.   
   
   Important Parameters for point-cloud-generation in JWildfire (use "Output type" POINTCLOUD to enable it):
     CELL-SIZE: the program uses an octree to quantize the space into little small cubes. All samples inside a cube
                are later condensed into one point of the point-cloud. So, this setting basically affects the 
                "resolution" of the generated mesh. But beware, please make it only smaller in small steps, 
                otherwise memory consumption may grow in an "explosive" way   
     RENDER QUALITY: overall number of samples, increase it only if your mesh has noise/holes in it  
     OUTPUT FORMAT: you may either use *.ply or *.obj. But beware, this option has also an impact on the generation
                    of the point-cloud:
                      PLY-Format: only vertices ("points"), with color and alpha channel (works good for Houdini)
                      OBJ-Format: vertices and 1-point-polygons, NO color and NO alpha channel (works good for Lightwave Hypervoxels)

  - Fix bug reading repeated variations in a transform. By Rick Sidwell
  - Added lgamma to Math.lib for gamma variation to work.
  - Fixed some performance problem in solid rendering 
  
V3.11r2 (05.06.2017)
 - fixed a problem with calculation of normals in solid rendering

V3.11 (04.06.2017)
- New Variations 
  - Cot2_BS,Csc2_BS,Tan2_BS,Sec2_BS,Exp2_BS,Sin2_BS,Csch2_BS,Cosh2_BS,Sech2_BS,Coth2_BS,Sinh2_BS,andTanh2_BS complex variations by cothe with added variables by Brad Stefanov
  - Cosq,Sinq,Tanq,Tanhq,Coshq,Sinhq,Cotq,Cothq,Cscq,Cschq,Estiq,Secq,Sechq from the Quaternion Apo Plugin Pack by zephyrtronium implemented into JWF by Brad Stefanov
- Fixes
  - Fixed bug in TileHlp. by Brad Stefanov
  - Fixed Log_tile with new variation Tile_log for keeping compatibility ... will keep both variations since they work in different ways. By Brad Stefanov
  - Fixed bugs in XTrb by Rick Sidwell
  - Changed getCoeffxy to getXYCoeffxy for variations that use them. By Rick Sidwell
  - Fixed bugs with the Falloff3 variations. By Rick Sidwell
  - Fix misc. variation bugs. Most pre and post variations should assign, not add their results. Fixed this in multiple variations to match the original apo plugins. By Rick Sidwell
- Misc  
  - rendering/processor-usage is more smooth now, avoids blocking (may slightly decrease render speed, but is more responsive on most systems. 
    If max render speed is extremely important for you, than keep the old version) - by Andreas Maschke
  - "subflame_wf" - variation now also supports flame-sequences as input (to animate the subflame) - by Andreas Maschke  
    
V3.10 (21.04.2017)
 - Image-quality:
   - new "Filtering"-option at the Anti-Aliasing/Filtering-tab to distinguish between the various types of filtering: 
     GLOBAL_SHARPENING, GLOBAL_SMOOTHING, ADAPTIVE. The "Filter kernel" option is populated accordingly.
   - new MITCHELL_SMOOTH-filter kernel (derived from MITCHELL), which is now the default  
   - improved the behaviour of sharpening filters (causing less artifacts)
   - "Sharpness indicator" and "Low density"-parameters at the "Anti-Aliasing/Filter"-tab (affects only adaptive filtering)
   - new experimental adaptive MITCHELL_SINEPOW-filter (sharpenung details, smoothing "unsharp" areas as well as areas with low density)        
   - new "low brightness"-property to show/hide areas with lower density, increasing this value usually leads to more detail, while decreasing 
     this value may help to hide unwanted border areas
   - increased default oversampling to 2 in order to increase default quality
 
 - Editing:
   - reimplemented the preview-cache (all options at the coloring-tab do not need a recalculation do show changes). In general, all properties
     which do not need a re-render are indicated by a star at the label, e.g. "Brightness*". Is is recommended to do a quickrender before adjusting them,
     so can apply changes in almsot realtime to a decent image.
   - improved the quality of the preview in the main editor    
   - the channel-mixer also works in "realtime-mode" now   
   - new color-balancing options at the "Coloring"-tab

 - Flame-saving/flame-thumbnail-selection
   - new SaveAll-button which saves all selected flames into a single file (thanks to Michael Bourne for the suggestion)
   - new checkbox at each flame-thumbnail to (de)select it
   - new popup-menus at the flame-thumbnails (press the right mouse-button over a button to display the menu):
     - remove-button: new popup-menu to remove all or remove selected flames
     - checkbox (sometimes referred as "select-button": new popoup-menu to toggle selection or deselect all
     - added confirmation dialog to the thumbnail-delete button
 
 - Background-gradients:
   - new 2x2 gradient-type for the background of fractals , may also be changed in "realtime mode"
   - new 2x2+c gradient-type for the background of fractals (which is the new default)
   
 - Mesh-Generator: 
   - optional post-smooth (Taubin-smooth) in the mesh generator  
   - removed the parameters "Thickness mod" and "Thickness samples" (just fix your model if is has "holes") in the mesh generator 
   - improved the rotation-behaviour of the mesh-preview in the Mesh-Generator  
   - improved the heuristics to calculate "depth" when creating a mesh from a voxelstack   
   - fixed (again) a serious bug in the Mesh-Generator: when rendering image-stacks 
     each image inside a slice was the same. This causing meshes to be very 
     "chunky", depending on slice-size. (The original fix was lost due to an unknown reason)

 - Misc
   - new "Machine"-random-flame-generator
   - detect flames with invalid (xaos) settings and stop to render them
   - indicator-mode for adapative filtering (i. e. showing sharp/smooth regions)
   - fixed some labels which were not scale accordingly the global "tinaFontScale"-property
   - rearranged some controls at the coloring-tab
   - new variations, provided by Brad Stefanov ("waves2_radial", "spliptic_bs", "circlesplit", "log_tile2", "mobiq", "tile_hlp")
   - lots of new presets for the "isosfplot3d_wf"-variation, provided by Frank Baumann and Brad Stefanov
   - some performance increase on some of the DOF-blur-shapes
   - increased quality of DOF in 3D-mode, but needs much more time to compute
   - removed the color-oversampling/jittering-option
  
V3.02 (12.03.2017)
 - new and powerful "dla3d_wf"-variation ("diffusion limited aggregation") which may even utilize 3d-meshes as nodes/junctions
 - solid-random-flame-generators also make use of the "dla3d_wf"-variation
 - improved the speed of the "dla_wf"-variation
 - bugfix in the "mobiusN"-variation
 - small improvements/bugfixes

V3.01 (06.01.2017)
 - Fixed a serious bug in the Mesh-Generator: when rendering image-stacks 
   each image inside a slice was the same. This causing meshes to be very 
   "chunky", depending on slice-size. 
   The only workaround was to set slice-size to, i. e. rendering one image 
   per slice, which causes a major slowdown. 
 - minor improvement in rendering speed
 - new "isosfplot3d_wf"-variation for plotting iso-surfaces (may be very slow on old machines)
 - new "dc_color"-parameter for the "colormap_wf" and "post_colormap_wf"-variations
   to turn coloring off (in case you want only use the image as heightmap)
 - new "blend_colormap" -parameter for the "colormap_wf" and "post_colormap_wf"-variations
   to improve quality
    
V3.00 (29.11.2016)
3D SOLID RENDERING
 - completely new 3d (solid) rendering mode for flame fractals, featuring
     - ambient shadows
     - distant light-sources
     - specular lighting, several diffuse-response functions
     - reflection-mapping
     - hard and soft shadows
     - z-buffer-output

 - new "obj_mesh_wf" and "obj_mesh_primitive_wf"-variations to allow you to integrate 
   meshes as shapes into your fractals. While "obj_mesh_wf" allows you to load arbitrary
   meshes (e .g. found in the web, there are tons of free meshes out there), you may
   use "obj_mesh_primitive_wf" to use numerous predifined presets     
 - both variations support:
    - uv-colormaps
    - uv-displacement-maps
    - geometry-smoothing (using the Taubin-smooth-algorithm)        

 - new "yplot2d_wf"-, "yplot3d_wf"- and "parplot2d_wf"-variations to generate geometry
   by plotting arbitrary mathematical functions (e.g. "sin(x*x+z*z)")
 - all of those variations contain many very cool presets, e.g. there are 35 presets
   included in the "parplot2d_wf"-variaton, just slide through them by changing the 
   "preset_id"
 
 - new "plane_wf"-variation for easy creation of a textured plane
 - script-generator (which creates scripts from a flame) also creates solid-attributes 
   for solid flames
 
 - support for invisible objects which can receive shadows. This way you can let 
   fractals cast real-looking shadows on objects inside a background-image, inspired 
   by Oak Fractal Sandbox by David Byrd (http://www.davidbyrd.io/)
 - this options is supported by the variations "obj_mesh_wf", "obj_mesh_primitive_wf"
   and "plane_wf"  

 - completely new DOF for solid rendering with bokeh-effects. This DOF is a post-effect 
   (and works totally different than the regular DOF) and is not visible in the fast-preview(!). 
   But, it also gives better results.
   One way to adjust the DOF is to turn solid rendering of in order to show the regular DOF 
   in fast-preview, adjust it (position and strength), 
   and then turn solid rendering on again 

 - new "Solid Julia3D"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid (experimental)"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid (stunning)"-random-flame-generator to create random solid flames
 - new "Solid Labyrinth"-random-flame-generator 
 - new option in the Prefrences to disable solid-flame-random-generators inside the global "All"-random-flame-generator

IMPROVED UI 
 - huge UI change: the main flame-window was broken into multiple smaller windows
 - new Navigator-window to make it easier to navigate between windows
 - window-state for all windows inside the desktoip is saved in the Preferences
 - new "Tips of the day"-window, may be turned off 
 - the Welcome-window (still providing some useful links) is not show per default, 
   but you can reach it in the menu
 - Customizable background and convenience-darkening effect (see 
   desktopBackgroundImagePath  and desktopBackgroundDarkenAmount in the Preferences)
 - supplied a background-image from my own library  
 - removed the combobox to select the edit-plane, and added three buttons in the 
   main editor area instead
 - new "List of changes"-window to display the list of changes made in the software 
 - improved image-quality for scaled image-display on the desktop (e. g. after 
   loading an image or displaying a rendered image)
 - option to auto-reload saved images from the interactive renderer (in order so be 
   able to check them quickly), may be turned off in the Preferences
 - option to manually save a z-buffer-image in the interactive renderer
 - buttons to easily randomize light-position and light-color (for solid flames)
 - the params in the nonlinear-tab can now get "expanded" in order to access them
   all at one time, thanks to Martin Flink to the suggestion!
 - new parameter tinaDefaultExpandNonlinearParams in the Preferences to turn the 
   expansion of the nonlinear-param-controls per default to on
 - exchanged some icons in the main editor
 - variations-editing: the controls use non-fractional step-size when changing a parameter having integer-values (like 
   power of "julia3D"-variation) 
 
GPU RENDERING
 - experimental gpu-rendering by integration of FACLRender, and external GPU
   renderer, made by Steven Brodhead (see the integrated info-window for more
   details) 
 - new info-window about GPU-rendering
 - new GPU-render window to interactively render flames, only available 
   under Windows. 
   Quick way to test out if a certain flame works, you would usually do this, 
   before you animate it, and then finally use the batch-renderer with enabled 
   GPU-renderer to render a sequence. 
 - integrated the external OpenCL-renderer in the batch-renderer
 - new option tinaFACLRenderOptions in the Preferences to influence the options 
   used to invoke the external GPU render 

MAC OS X SUPPORT
 - native installer for Mac OS
 - some optimizations for Mac OS X to improve user experience 
 - made "System" the default theme under MacOS
 - renamed the main class to JWildfire in order to get "JWildfire" displayed as application on Mac
 - changed to initial directory for the directory-select-box in the flame-browser (works now on Mac)
 - set up default resolution- and quality-profiles when no preferences file could be found

MISC
 - new "Orchids"-random-flame-generator
 
 - New local hue parameter at the Local Gamma tab (called "Gamma"), allowing much more variations in color than using only the default coloring
 - New randomizer-buttons at the Local Gamma tab, to randomize each parameter individually
 
 - added a quarter-render-size option in the Interactive Renderer

 - Removed the Shading-tab and all the options for Blur-Shading, Distance-Color-Shading and Pseudo3D-Shading. 
     - the popular blur-shading was re-introduced as new option under the "DOF / Bokeh" - tab as "Post blur"
     - distance-color-shading was removed completely, if you liked it, please keep an old version
     - Pseudo3D-shading is obsolete due to new 3d rendering   

 - removed the rarely used brightness-slider in the main editor
 - removed the rarely used Chaotica-bridge

 - recreated the SystemInfo window and added a function to clear the cache (which hold resources like fonts, meshes, ... 
   in order to speed up future calculations)
 - new "Transfer to Interactive Renderer"-button in the main editor
 - removed the MutaGen-button in the main editor

 - added two new parameters to the "subflame_wf" variation: "colorscale_z" (adds depth to the outer flame according 
   to the color-information of the inner flame) and "use_colors" (use the computed color-information of the inner 
   flame as color of the outer flame)
 - the "subflame_wf"-variation also respect hidden samples now and can recover iteration after receiving 
   invalid results (e. g. division by zero)  

 - added new parameters "axis", "centre_x", "centre_y" and "centre_y" to the "pre_wave3D_wf"-variation
 - added experimental "direct_color"-parameter to the "truchet"-variation

 - new "MobiusN"-variation by eralex

   the variations-list supplied by Don Town 
 
 - 3 new SINEPOW-filter-kernels (with predefined power-levels)
 
 - the "Rnd"-button now can also operate on newly created flames
 
 - refined the default resolution- and quality-profiles
 
 - improved the speed of the MutaGen
 
 - changed the layout of the sub-tabs "DoF" and "Solid rendering"

 - slightly shorter startup time due to the use of more simple random-flames-generator at startup
 
 - support for loading and saving Fusion-compatible *.spl-files in the motion-curve-editor

 - moved the "Rnd"-button at a new "Misc"-tab  
     
V2.60 REVISION 2 (26.10.2015):
 - Experimental font-scale (for screens with much higher resolution)

V2.60 (12.10.2015):
 - New progressive preview, which allows progressive rendering while editing. 
   While it needs much CPU-power it is a great new way to explore interesting spots inside your fractals, it is especially of great use in combination 
   with the "Fine Edit"-option.
   It also allows you browse random-flames or flames generated by scripts at higher quality because the quality increases while you are watching at 
   the fractal.    
  
   There is a new button to toggle progressive-preview in the main-editor (you may switch between classic preview and progressive preview at any time), 
   and there is a new option in the Preferences to specify the initial state of this button (tinaEditorProgressivePreview).
   So, if you machine is too slow, you may just permanently disable it and use the default preview which was also slightly improved.
      
   There are new options tinaEditorProgressivePreviewMaxRenderTime and tinaEditorProgressivePreviewMaxRenderQuality in the Preferences to control the render-time of progressive preview.
  
 - any variation may be now be easily toggled to be pre_/normal/post_ - variation. This feature uses minimal changes in the user-interface
   and it will not break anything, e. g. all scripts should be remain intact without any further change
 - added the possiblity to change the position of variations inside a transform 

 - New "Low priority"-option in the the launcher. This options is only available under Windows and enabled by default. It should cause a general smoother behaviour of the software. 

 - providing a more advanced editor with basic syntax-highlighting for editing scripts and custom variations (thanks CozyG for the java8-related fix)
 - separate (and resizable) window for editing scripts


 - new "Batch Renderer"-button which quicksaves the current flame and sends it together with size/quality information to the batch-renderer 
 - new "post_axis_symmetry_wf"-variation
 - new "post_point_symmetry_wf"-variation
 - new "mobius_strip" by CozyG
 - removed the confusing "H"-Button from the main-editor in order to free space, cleaned up the main toolbar
 - adjustment to brightness-calculation when using post-symmetry
 - rearranged some buttons so that it is unlikely to press the MutaGen-button by wanting to press Undo (important because the MutaGen currently can not cancelled)
 - new "Reset"- and "Reset All"-buttons on the Xaos-tab
 - Optimization of preview-rendering: do not re-render flame after switching "triangles"
 - Optimization of preview-rendering: do not re-render flame after switching editor modes
 - new "Spirals"-random-flame-generator which can generate awesome results, thanks Tate27kh from dA for the inspiration!
 - new "Ghosts"-random-flame-generator
 - new "Spirals3D"-random-flame-generator (which utilizes the "Spirals"-generator)
 - improved the "Brokat"-random-flame-generator (uses the ability to switch variation-types, see below)
 - improved the "Simple Tiling"-random-flame-generator
 - reimplemented the "Brokat3D"-random-flame-generator to generate more visually appealing results
 - reimplemented the "Gnarl3D"-random-flame-generator to generate more visually appealing results
 - new Option "tinaAdvancedCodeEditor" in the Prefs to turn off the advanced code-editor. May not work on all systems/may not look good on all themes, especially the true dark ones.
 - the Script-From-Flame-Generator also supports flames with 3D-affine transforms
 - the Script-From-Flame-Generator also respects the new variation-priority
 - created a v6 of the Custom_Variation_Loader_GH-script by CozyG, which now used the new Prefs-option for the path and included this version as standard script
 - new property tinaCustomVariationsPath in the Prefs to specify the path for external custom_variations (used by the Custom_Variation_Loader_GH script by CozyG).
 - modifications to ScriptParamsDialog and ScriptParamsForm to keep script params modal dialog centered on JWildfire main frame. 
 - added use of tinaAdvancedCodeEditorFontSize and tinaAdvancedCodeEditorColorFix to ResourceDialog.
 - performance-improvement of the MutaGen
 - fixed some zoom-calculation-bug when zooming with the mouse-wheel

 - updated the Win64-distribution to java8

V2.57 (09.08.2015):
 - Major speedup in the interactive renderer
 - Tonemapping in the interactive renderer should now be exactly the same as in the fixed renderer (i.e., the final images should be the same when the quality is the same) 
 - while saving an image the rendering is paused in order to avoid to too heavy load or even freezes of the java-process
 - fixed the behaviour of the main progress-bar (was sometimes not updated)
 - Windows-Launcher:  fixed the problem with paths which contain spaces (i.e. you can now have the JWildfire-folder at any local folder, e.g. at "C:\Program Files" etc.)
 - added some Author-informations to the JWildfire.exe-file, otherwise some virus-scanner seems to be too nervous about the file ;-)
 - slightly increased the default image-quality

 - Problem fixed regarding parameter handling in the variations "trade", "w", "x", "y" and "z"

V2.56 (21.07.2015):

- new sample-jittering- and color-oversampling-option for improved render-quality. The default value is off, this may be set in the Preferences.
- new post-noise-filtering-option for redusing noise of the final noise by using an adaptive gaussian filter. The default value is off, this may be set in the Preferences.
- added a brief description of all of this options in the official Wiki: http://wiki.jwildfire.org/index.php?title=Manual_RenderQualityFlameFractals

- changed the memory management/layout of the iteration buffer (rendering should now take significantly less memory, and initialisation of rendering runs substantly faster, comes to a cost of only slightly degraded render time)

- the final image-generating-process now works fully multi-threaded and should be faster
- added a new experimental option "Opacity" to control the opacity of the foreground when rendering an image with background (often those renders caused the loss of too many details)

- new "Pseudo3D"-random-flame-generator
- improved the "Xenomorph"-random-flame-generator
- improved the "Cross"-random-flame-generator

- some more useful statistics in the interactive renderer, e.g. absolute render-speed-indicator to make it easier to compare different settings (render speed means the quality level the renderer can reach in one hour)

- the windows-launcher (JWildfire.exe) should now be much smarter to find a valid Java-install
- completely removed the izpack-installer (until now there were always two files: a *.zip for users who just wanted to unzip, or an izpack-based installer which caused too many problems)
- there are now two packages available: platform-independant without jdk and any dll's, and windows64 with jdk and certain dll's   
- removed the applet from the distribution

- the Chaotica-integration is now disabled by default (in order to hide the export-button which may occupy important space for some users)

- fixed a bug in the crop-like variations
- fixed a bug regarding autoimatically saving the current flame in the iteractive renderer
- some refactoring of the structure synthesizer
- completely removed all experimental opencl-code

V2.50 R2 (27.05.2015):
 - Added a new option tinaIntegrationChaoticaAnimationExport to the preferences. This option controls if the 
   flames which are exchanged over the Chaotica-bridge are animated flames or static flames.
   In case you export them as static flames and have not a Studio licence for Chaotica you may render in higher resolutions.
   Per default this option is set to off, i.e. exported flames are static.
 - Fixed a problem with the launcher regarding installation-path containing spaces    
 
V2.50 R1 (25.05.2015):
 - fixed a bug with the "Linear3D"-variation

V2.34 (21.02.2015):
 - powerful new sub-application to create iflames (you can reach it form the main window-menu), including a particle-simulation 
   to animate them, but please beware that this new application needs a very powerful computer,

 - button for simply-generation of bokeh-like effects in the main editor - it's pure fun!
 - new "Rect"-bokeh-style
 - ability to use/create motion-curves made from mp3-audio, it has never been easier to create a sound-sync motion of a flame-fractal!

 - tried to make the Interactive Renderer behave more "smooth"
 - added two new parameters to "fract_*"-variations: "z_fill" to fill the vertical gaps in 3d-mode, "z_logscale" to use log-scale in z-direction (nice for creating 3D-meshes)
 - fixed an unwanted "dot" in the "primitives_wf"-variation, when drawing a pyramid-shape
 - new experimental "xheart_blur"-variation (which bases on "xheart" by Xyrus02)
 - fixed dark background in the help-section

V1.90 (24.08.2014):
 - Motion-Curves in the Main-Editor:
    - after a long period of development I finally decided to enable the motion-curve-editor in the main editor! This means you can define 
      a motion curve (drawn with you mouse) for each flame-property to create awesome animations, using the most easy-to-use interface possible. 
      You may even add controlled motion-blur! 
      Or you can use this feature to modify different properties at the same time to find "interesting spots". The possibilities are endless :-)
      You will see a new large button to enable/disable this new features. I. E. if you dont care about animations, you will notice no change,
      unless you press this button :-)    
      A video-tutorial on all this stuff will come later...
    - preview-playback-function for the global motioncurve-editing-mode
    - automatically save the flame rendered in the interactive renderer as "jwf_ir_current.flame" (like an auto quicksave). So, in case of a rare crash you will always keep you latest flame in the IR.
      
 - Mesh-Generator:
    - new Option to skip slices in the mesh-generating-process  
    - added some image-pre-filtering-options to modify (smooth) the generated slices 
    - some experimental option to thicken details, may get obsolete by using the pre-filters (requires more testing, any feedback is welcome)
    - Created an official JWildfire-shop at shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/jwildfire (It is not about making money, just to show what 
      the mesh-generator can do. But you can also buy this stuff, of course, I have tried to make the prices as fair as possible)  
    
 - Other changes:
    - improved the speed and "smoothness" of the interactive renderer
    - extended the "mandelbrot"-variation by three params: "seed" (allowing fixed random shapes which may be better animated), "max_points" (to specify the number of fixed major points which build the shape, good if you plan to increase the surface by using a blur-variation) and "rnd_z_range" (specify a range at the z-direction where the major points get distributed, can lead to much more interesting models)
    - added new shape TRIANGLE and PYRAMID to "primitives_wf"-variation (right, it is now easy to build the pyramids :D)
    - fixed the encoding of the start_mac.command file, thanks again to Matthew Townsend
    - new "sph3D"-variation by Xyrus02
    - added the methode getCurrLayer() to the script-runner-interface
    - some additions to the FAQ-section    
    
V1.80 (10.08.2014):
 - new module to generate meshes from 3d-flame-fractals! The module consists of three parts: 
     - a volumetric renderer
     - a mesh generator which uses the marching-cubes-algorithm to generate a mesh from a stack of rendered images
     - a previewer which can either create a quick-preview by some internal renderer or a high quality-preview by using the integrated sunflow-renderer 
   In comparison to some other solutions the module has the following strengths: 
     - it works multi-threaded and has decent speed
     - it creates not only vertices, but also vertex normals
     - it is able to process really huge meshes, if you have enough memory
     - the mesh-generator supports additional smoothing and can process any image-stack in the formats supported by JWildfire. So probably you could also convert Mandelbulb3D Voxelstack by using this modeule (I have not tried it, so any feedback is welcome) 
     - it is extensible and open source   
 - restructured the Help/About-section, updated some informations, added an Aphophysis-users-hints-page
 - improved the "Strong hue"-random-color-generator to produce more interesting results
 - black-border-fix for the "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "log_db"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "asteria"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "ztwister"-variation by dark-beam
 - made the "custom_wf"-variations more robust to errors. If an error occurs during regular calculation (e.g. after loading a flame with errors in the java-code) the variation does nothing. If you edit the code, you cant save it until you fixed the error
 - improved start-script for Macs by Matthew Townsend
 - new fluent-API to create sunflow-scenes (only interesting for developers)

V1.70 (06.07.2014):
 - new tab for local modification of gamma, contrast and saturation on a transform-basis. 
   Those work similiar to the color values ("color" and "color-speed"), but they control changes in applied color values, 
   rather than specifying color values themselfs. This is a true new addition to the Flame Fractal Algorithm itself, 
   and makes it much more easy to create flame fractals with more depth, without the need of endless fiddling with the gradient :-)

 - made the "custom_wf"-variation more robust against compile/syntax errors
 
V1.64 (20.06.2014):

 - improved the smoothness of modifying parameters by dragging the mouse by about factor 2.5
 - the "Fine"-adjustment is now also taken into account when modifying parameters by dragging the mouse. If the "Fine"-button is enabled all changes have a increased smoothness (precision) by factor 10.      
 - new experimental and super-cool "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "loonie2" and "loonie3"-variation by dark-beam

 - new "Strong hue"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Smooth"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Monochrome"-random-gradient-generator

 - new "saturation"-setting under "Coloring" (which affects the saturation of the final image. A saturation of 1.0 is the default value. Lower values decrease saturation, i. E. the fractals appears more "gray", higher values add more levels of "color" )

 - new "color map"-random-flame-generator, using randomly chosen images from your image-collection as color-map (you must specify the base-path in the prefs, but please BEWARE that this path is scanned recursively, so please check if you have any "forbidden" images there). This generator is NOT included in the "All"-random-flame-generator, so it must be selected explicitely

 - new "Move to"/"Copy to"-functions in the flame browser
 - some additional "post_*"-scripts for the Easy Movie Maker

 - controls in the editor have now a shadow the increase the contrast with the background (can be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorControlsWithShadows)

     - dramatically increased the speed of evaluating motion curves
     - motions in the Easy Movie Maker now respect the FPS setting (rather than calculating the speed by the total number of frames)
     - removed *_NEG animation-scripts, refactoring of the Easy Movie Maker
 - additional camera-controls (x-, y- and z-position), this makes it possible to create really "different" images!  
 - new "dc_hexes_wf" variation, which is derived from the well-known "hexes"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information 
 - new "dc_crackle_wf variation, which is derived from the well-known "crackle"-variation, but uses Voronoi-distance to apply additional color-information

 - removed the JWildfireC sub project (will be replaced by some OpenCL-based stuff later)

V1.30 (02.03.2014):
 - New concept of "post-symmetries". A post symmetry is something like a "final transform after a final transform". 
 But unlike to a ordinary final transform it can clone samples and modify those clones, making it very efficient to create fractals with certain symmetry.
 For example, for a mirror-like-symmetry it creates for any input sample one mirrored clone.        
 You also could achieve this by designing the fractal, but using the post-symmetries makes it much more intuitive and faster to render. 
 - New concept of "random-symmetry-generators". Those are a parallel concept to random flame generators and can used in combination. 
  I.E. random-symmetry-generators apply to random-fractal a randomly-chosen-symmetry.
 - Some initial random-symmetry-generators:
    - "XAxis"
    - "YAxis" (not only differing in the axis)
    - "Point"
    - "All (sparse)" (applies symmetry only at a certain probability, this is the default)

V0.68 (14.04.2013):
 - re-implemented the script-tab: scripts are now maintained in a folder-like structure. There are two main folders: "Built-in scripts" (examples) and "Your scripts". The latter points to an arbitrary folder on your harddisc and holds your own scripts. You can easily create and copy scripts either using the new functions in JWildfire or by just copying/creating them manually. Additionally, scripts now always contain of two files: the description (plain text) and the code (Java code)

 - updated the link to the new JWildfire Open Group in the welcome-screen

V0.67 (20.03.2013):
 - MutaGen: an amazing new module to interactively create mutations of a certain flame. 
   There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties). 
   Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame) and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), 
   generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.  
   You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time. 
   Unlike to many other programs of this type, there is a true history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time. 
   Even if there are so many possible parameter combinations which may lead to singularies and huge computation times, the programm 
   achieves predictable computation times for each whole generation. This is done by delegating the mutation process to separate threads 
   and eventually just killing them.
 - new "sintrange" variaton by Ffey
 - new "Sort" button on the gradient transform tab (to create a new gradient which is sorted by hue and luminance)
 - the view is now centered after starting a render in the interactive renderer

V0.65 (24.02.2013):
 - new "dimishZ" property to create more realistic looking pseudo-3D-renders
 - dropped the concept of the external renders! The only remaining benefit of the external renders was the lower memory consumption, but this problem was ales solved in this release!
 - added an abstraction level to iteration rasters. There are currently two implementations available: single and double precision. Double precision was the previously used, but single precision need less memory and leeds to te same results in many cases, so its the new default. But you can change this in the preferences
 - the thumbnails can now be loaded into the main area also by single right click with the mouse (as suggested by Don Town)
 - new "gdoffs" variaton by Xyrus02 (as also suggested by Don :-))
