<h3>Tip 003: Java heap space</h3>
The common error "Java heap space" means the software ran out of memory.<br><br>
The software only uses the amount of memory you specify in the launcher. So, often it makes sense to start the program
again and increase the value "memory to use" in the launcher (if your system has memory left)<br><br>
To reduce the required amount of memory you may reduce the render-resolution.<br>

<h3>Tip 004: Solid rendering</h3>
When realtime-editing of a flame with solid-rendering appears too slow, just turn off solid rendering temporarily. 
Continue editing and finally turn in on again to proceed.<br>
This works especially good for editing DOF-setting. Because they appear in non-solid-mode in realtime, while DOF 
is a post-processing-effect in solid-rendering-mode, i. e. does not appear in realtime-editing.

<h3>Tip 005: Parametric plots</h3>
There are many presets (formulas + variable ranges of interest) included in the parplot2d_wf-variation.<br> 
To switch between them change the "preset_id" parameter (range: 0...currently maximum available preset).<br>
To edit you own formula turn off preset-mode by setting the parameter "use_preset" to 0. <br>

<h3>Tip 006: Memory</h3>
You may see both the available and occupied memory (RAM) in the "System Information" window.<br>
Some memory is occupied by caches in order to accelerate future calculations. 
For example, Bitmaps, Fonts and Meshes are hold in the cache. <br>
You may clear the cache at any time in the "System Information" window, in order to free memory.
