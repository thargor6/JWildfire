PolySurf: User's Guide

Congratulations on your new fractal variation! PolySurf is a powerful and complex tool designed to create intricate, symmetrical, 3D shapes with a "many-surfaced" appearance. This guide will walk you through what each parameter does so you can explore its full potential.

Getting Started: The Core Shape
These are the most fundamental parameters that define the basic shape and complexity of the fractal.

c: This is the main scaling parameter for the "curl" effect. Think of it as the master control for the fractal's complexity.

Small values (like the default 0.3) tend to create more detailed, web-like structures.

Larger values can make the shape more solid or cause it to explode into chaos.

Tip: Start with small adjustments to c to see how it affects the overall shape. This is a very sensitive control!

Symmetry & Mirroring
These parameters control the overall symmetry of your fractal.

mirrorX, mirrorY, mirrorZ: These are simple on/off switches (1 for on, 0 for off). When turned on, they randomly mirror the shape across the corresponding axis. Turning on mirrorX and mirrorY is what creates the 4-way symmetry that was key to our final design.

Transforming the Shape
These groups of parameters modify the shape in different ways. The fun comes from seeing how they interact with each other.

1. Folding
enableFold: An on/off switch to activate the folding effect.

foldX, foldY: Controls the distance of the "crease" from the center. Folding adds sharp edges and repeating, layered details to the surface, making it look more complex and geometric.

2. Rotation
rotX, rotY, rotZ: These parameters twist and warp the final shape. Unlike moving the main transform triangle, this rotates the result of the calculation, leading to interesting distortions and shearing effects.

3. Spherical Inversion
enableInvert: An on/off switch to activate inversion.

invertRadius: Controls the size of an invisible sphere. The fractal shape is "reflected" across the surface of this sphere. This is a powerful effect for creating hollow, cavernous spaces and sharp, filigree-like details.

Offsets: Changing the Core Geometry
There are two types of offsets in PolySurf, and they have very different effects.

1. Pre-Scaling Offset (The "Offset" section)
enableOffset, offsetX, offsetY, offsetZ: This offset is applied before the main curl calculation. It fundamentally changes the core geometry and can drastically alter the shape of the fractal. The default settings you chose (enableOffset=1, offsetX=1.0, offsetY=1.0) are key to the look we developed.

2. Julia Mode (The "Julia" section)
julia, juliaX, juliaY, juliaZ: This offset is applied right at the beginning. It shifts the entire "calculation space." Turning this on is like exploring a parallel universe version of your fractal—the shapes will be related but different. It's a fantastic way to find new, unexpected forms without changing your main parameters.

Coloring
colorMode: A switch to change how the fractal is colored.
  0 (Off): Uses the standard flame coloring.
  1 (Distance): Creates a color gradient based on how far a point is from the center.
  2 (Angle): Creates a radial, "pie slice" color pattern.
  3 (Height): Creates a color gradient based on the Z-axis (height).

colorSpeed: Controls the intensity and repetition of the color patterns.

Have fun exploring!
